Democracy is in trouble because <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/68/the-new-libertarian-elitists/">most people are biased and most people
    are often mistaken</a>.  But democracy can be effective when it is
structured to lead to discussions in which people present arguments
for various sides.

The article refutes the claims of certain rich people who argue that
markets, or the cleverest people, should rule.  They call themselves
"libertarians", but I don't think they deserve that term since they
advocate subjugation of nearly everyone.  Like most people who
call themselves "libertarians", their real goal is for the an elite
to dominate most of society and to get rid of systems that help the
non-rich.  That is why I call them <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#anti">"antisocialists"</a>.
