Musk announced that Twitter would censor access to 
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-limits-access-to-some-tweets-in-turkey-ahead-of-tightly-contested-election-171432725.html?src=rss">tweets in Turkey to
placate Erdoğan.</a>
<p>
This is the same excuse that Apple used for helping to carry out
Chinese censorship in China.  But is Turkey really better off having
Twitter keep operation under Erdoğan's censorship, than having him
very visibly shut it down?  I don't think so.

*Musk, with business relationships in Turkey, comes under fire for
Twitter censorship aiding [Erdoğan]

<p>
Is Musk's excuse bogus as well as wrong?  Others claim he is censoring
Twitter more than the Turkish regime demands of other media.  Maybe
Musk simply desired to boost autocracy in Turkey, and only pretends he
is doing so under threat.
