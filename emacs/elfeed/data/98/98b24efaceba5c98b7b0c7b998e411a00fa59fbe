<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve installed a while ago and used plasma-meta.</p> <p>My ram usage before I open any apps is sitting about 2.86 gb, and cranks to &gt;=6gb once I open firefox.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to limit the ram usage even further, and have checked out the performance page on the wiki, but I&#39;m already comfortable with the settings listed there.</p> <p>I&#39;ve installed Tumbleweed in a VM, and it generally starts with around 1.56 gb and hits around between 2.5 to 3 gb with firefox open. </p> <p>One difference is that Akonadi isn&#39;t running on tumbleweed, and I have no use for it on my Arch system. </p> <p>how can I gracefully shut down akoandi? I Have tried using <code>akonadictl stop</code> however this raises a Kcrash and core dump, and seems to restart akonadi.</p> <p>What are my options here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomXUsr"> /u/RandomXUsr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1393n8u/kde_pimakonadi_how_to_disable_or_remove_used/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1393n8u/kde_pimakonadi_how_to_disable_or_remove_used/">[comments]</a></span>
