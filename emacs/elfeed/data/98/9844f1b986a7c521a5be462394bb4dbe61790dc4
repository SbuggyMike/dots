<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I tried out vanilla Emacs for the first time in many years to get a good grasp on fundamentals before moving on to more advanced topics and the keybindings are just as terrible as I remember them being. I know Doomemacs offers a more Vim-like experience but I worried about getting lost without knowing more basics. So I was wondering whether it&#39;s a good path to basically just consider Doomemacs its own experience and start from there, as it were the basic editor?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/readyready15728"> /u/readyready15728 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w18th7/is_it_a_good_idea_to_just_start_with_doomemacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w18th7/is_it_a_good_idea_to_just_start_with_doomemacs/">[comments]</a></span>
