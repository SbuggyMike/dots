<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>GLIBC 2.36 has broken EOS EAC for games running under proton on Arch. This ticket has the context: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051</a></p> <p>I&#39;ve tried to build the package from <a href="https://github.com/Frogging-Family/glibc-eac">https://github.com/Frogging-Family/glibc-eac</a> using makepkg. It was failing because gcc couldn&#39;t inline a function related to syslog. This turned out to be caused by some flags set on my system for makepkg. I didn&#39;t customize the flags. The chroot based approach for building packages was a saner choice.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried to use the method described in <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_clean_chroot">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_clean_chroot</a></p> <p>makechrootpkg -c -U myuser -r /tmpchroot gets stuck here:</p> <p>Summary of test results:</p> <p>5074 PASS</p> <pre><code> 90 UNSUPPORTED 14 XFAIL 8 XPASS </code></pre> <p>make[1]: Leaving directory &#39;/build/glibc/src/glibc&#39;</p> <p>This never exits. It just stays there forever. Is this an Arch build bug? How can I fix it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/foo_m0nkey"> /u/foo_m0nkey </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whsyxl/unable_to_build_glibceac/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whsyxl/unable_to_build_glibceac/">[comments]</a></span>
