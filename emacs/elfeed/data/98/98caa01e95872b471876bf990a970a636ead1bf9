<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From a regular end user perspective, it&#39;s a perfect setup. If I were to install a Linux based OS in my parents computers, this would be it. Minimal effort to maintain, applications are installed only from a trusted store, ability to micromanage app permissions with Flatseal. Yet I am still free to do whatever I want like in a regular distribution, like installing native packages with <code>transactional-update pkg install</code>. And given the fact that it&#39;s a rolling release, I never have to worry about dist-upgrades. Count me in, I&#39;m convinced.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ColdEggid"> /u/ColdEggid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3sbck/i_switched_to_microos_gnome_and_i_dont_think_im/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3sbck/i_switched_to_microos_gnome_and_i_dont_think_im/">[comments]</a></span>
