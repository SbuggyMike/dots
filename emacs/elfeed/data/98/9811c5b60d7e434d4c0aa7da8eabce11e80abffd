to Christianity.*

Many countries that call themselves "Muslim" impose that religion on
more or less everyone.  This is an offense against the freedom of every
citizen, including those who are currently Muslims and might want to
change.  They also punish people for criticizing the official religion
("blasphemy") &mdash; in <a href="/archives/2014-sep-dec#20_October_2014_(Death_sentences_for_blasphemy)">some countries with execution</a>.

Christian countries used to commit similar injustices, quite
generally, until the 1500s when a few began to adopt limited freedom
for a few Christian sects.  The Dutch Republic permitted Judaism as
well.  The UK didn't officially permit Jews until the mid 1800s,
although some lived there.  It discriminated against Catholics until
later.
