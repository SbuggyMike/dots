<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Long story short, I only type on the workman keyboard layout, it&#39;s the only layout I&#39;m proficient in. Most DE&#39;s and Linux installs already have the vanilla English version of it, however, I also type in Spanish and French, so I&#39;d like to have a (preferably GUI) program to remap some of the keys in order to have the special characters unique to those languages. I already did some research and apparently xbindkeys is that sort of program but I can&#39;t seem to get it to work, has anyone else had this problem? Anyhow, I&#39;m also looking for alternatives to tackle this problem. Thanks in advance!</p> <p>Note: before switching to Linux, I had this problem sorted on Windows 10 with a program called Keytweak, it let me remap keys to my liking, this would be the kind of thing I&#39;m looking for. There was also a Windows layout creator that was very useful.</p> <p>Extra question: is there a way to bind ctrl+delete to delete the entire word on Arch/KDE plasma.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/basedand-sarahpilled"> /u/basedand-sarahpilled </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w65t2g/creating_custom_keyboard_layouts_that_work_across/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w65t2g/creating_custom_keyboard_layouts_that_work_across/">[comments]</a></span>
