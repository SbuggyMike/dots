<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today, I installed Arch with XFCE for the first time, but I have used Manjaro and Endeavour Os arch-based, and their performance was good. But the vanilla arch seems extremely slow to me. Even opening a file requires a significant amount of time. Any tweaks for improving performance? I appreciate any help you can provide.</p> <p>My laptop configuration CPU: intel core i5 8th gen RAM: 4 GB HDD hard disk.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lonely-Maximum-3750"> /u/Lonely-Maximum-3750 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyyed6/arch_is_slow/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyyed6/arch_is_slow/">[comments]</a></span>
