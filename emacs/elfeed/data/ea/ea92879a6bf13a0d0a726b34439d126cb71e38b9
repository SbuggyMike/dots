<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>ZTGPS is a Linux+KDE native PIM application satisfying the same purpose as Garmin&#39;s &quot;BaseCamp&quot; software, which does not run on Linux. ZTGPS provides sophisticated query and sorting capabilities for GPS tracks. It is targeted at cyclists, runners, hikers, and anyone collecting GPS tracks from handheld units, particularly if you prefer data storage on your own computer to cloud based storage. A feature description and FAQ is available on the web site below. Binary packages for several popular distros are available under the Downloads tab.</p> <p>Version 1.12 includes a frequently user-requested feature to run external tools to supply data for import. In addition, automatic import of GPS data from a directory on startup or via manual trigger is available. There are improvements to program configuration, fixes to track simplification features, new Tandem and Recumbent bike categories with power estimation parameters, and a range of defect fixes and minor improvements.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.zombietrackergps.net/ztgps/">ZombieTrackerGPS web site</a></li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/ldutils-projects/zombietrackergps">gitlab source repo</a></li> </ul> <p>The web site&#39;s first gallery image is a UI screenshot which you can click to get a bigger version, if you want to quickly see what you&#39;re in for.</p> <hr/> <p>Recent changes:</p> <p><strong>Version 1.12</strong></p> <ul> <li>An Auto-Import feature now allows automatic importation of files from either external tools, or defined directories. This was a feature requested by several users. See the Auto-Import section under the Configuration area of the documentation for setup information.</li> <li>Redesign of the configuration dialog. The numerous cluttered tabs were becoming unwieldy. There is a new, tree based page selector. Many config pages have been decluttered to make them easier to understand. All settings are still available, but the organization is improved.</li> <li>The Simplify Track feature was not marking track data as dirty, so the track would not get saved to disk after a simplify operation unless something else subsequently marked it as dirty. Sorry about that. You may want to double check that any simplifications you made &quot;stuck&quot;. The simplify feature is useful to save space when tracks have many more points than you really need.</li> <li>Track moving power is now calculated using only points which have non-zero power. For example, time spent coasting on a bicycle does not factor into the average power displayed for the track. This is a more intuitive number, and will yield somewhat higher values depending on the amount of time spent not producing power.</li> <li>Heart rate percentages are now calculated based on age as of the start of each individual track, rather than on current age for all tracks. This presents more sensible data for older tracks. The same is true for Training Zone charts using the %HR method. This only happens when using the auto-calculated Max HR in the &quot;People&quot; tab of the program configuration, which is (220-age). See the &quot;Configuration/People&quot; documentation section for details.</li> <li>The Simplify Track preview info now makes more sense when selecting multiple points rather than entire tracks.</li> <li>The Simplify dialog was not properly reacting to the Adaptive Mode radio button.</li> <li>The Filter and View panes now works more like the others: single click to activate an item, and double click to edit.</li> <li>New Tandem transport icon for tandem bicycles.</li> <li>New Recumbent transport icon for recumbent trikes.</li> <li>Fixed incorrect tooltip in Climb Analysis pane column headers.</li> <li>Fixed track line pane buffer overflow With tracks holding multiple coincident points in different track segments.</li> <li>Improved tooltip behavior over Activity Summary charts. The annoying teardown and redraw no longer happens.</li> <li>Improved tooltip presentation and content for the Zone Analysis pie chart slices.</li> <li>Status bar now displays the map mode icon (Move, Select, or Add Points). Note that you can right click the status bar to customize it.</li> <li>Added new &#39;Help/Visit ZombieTrackerGPS Web Site&#39; menu to open the web site in the desktop default web browser.</li> <li>The &quot;Help/Donations&quot; link to the ZTGPS donation page in the About dialog was incorrect, and has been fixed.</li> <li>Documentation TOC entries were mistakenly non-localizable.</li> <li>Building: Fixed some clang-tidy warnings. Not all, but a lot. In a few cases, the static analyzer is off its rocker.</li> </ul> <p>For older changes, see the <a href="https://zombietrackergps.net/ztgps/history.html">History</a> page.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ztgpsld"> /u/ztgpsld </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wejgyh/version_112_of_zombietrackergps_released/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wejgyh/version_112_of_zombietrackergps_released/">[comments]</a></span>
