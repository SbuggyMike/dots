<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I am looking to purchase a handheld recorder that is similar to the Zoom H4N but a little bit cheaper. I am needing to use something like this to record my lessons and maybe use them in a practice room. I saw some people say that Tascam is a little bit better than Zoom, thoughts?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Special_Chard_9714"> /u/Special_Chard_9714 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wh2qa1/handheld_recorder_that_wont_break_my_bank/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wh2qa1/handheld_recorder_that_wont_break_my_bank/">[comments]</a></span>
