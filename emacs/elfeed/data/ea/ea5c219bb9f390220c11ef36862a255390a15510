<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><code>use-package</code> is not part of stock Emacs, so it can&#39;t be assumed that it&#39;s installed and available for an arbitrary Emacs user. Any <code>use-package</code>-based instructions for installing and setting up a package should also be accompanied by instructions that don&#39;t require its presence. Otherwise, it might present problems for new Emacs users who aren&#39;t using a <code>use-package</code>-based Emacs distro.</p> <p>(i don&#39;t have <code>use-package</code> installed myself, not because i have anything against it, but just because i haven&#39;t felt any need to move my decades-old config of thousands of lines across to using it.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flexibeast"> /u/flexibeast </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whoyz0/reminder_usepackage_is_not_part_of_stock_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whoyz0/reminder_usepackage_is_not_part_of_stock_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
