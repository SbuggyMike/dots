<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a vim user that is currently trying to switch to emacs, but I&#39;m having a bit of difficulty understanding the ideal workflow in emacs</p> <p>Currently, this is what my workflow looks like:</p> <p>Windows and workspaces are not used. If I need a new window, I open another emacs client and manage it with my TWM. If I need a new workspace, I use the TWM workspaces. I use buffers as a way to have related tasks stacked on top of each other within one area, but this utility seems fairly limited.</p> <p>I doubt emacs would have these features if they aren&#39;t useful somehow, so what do they contribute to a workflow? In other words, how would incorporating them make me more productive and efficient compared to my current workflow?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FearlessPolicy3206"> /u/FearlessPolicy3206 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vwphjm/questions_about_emacs_workflow/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vwphjm/questions_about_emacs_workflow/">[comments]</a></span>
