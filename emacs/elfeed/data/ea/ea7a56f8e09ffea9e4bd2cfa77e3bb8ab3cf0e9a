<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Checking the internet didn&#39;t really help much here.</p> <p>I just upgraded from an AMD Radeon RX 580 to an AMD Radeon RX 6600. Worked fine before, now X11 won&#39;t start, with the error &quot;no screens detected&quot;</p> <p>What&#39;s even weirder is when I start lightdm manually it works perfectly. What is happening here?</p> <p>EDIT: Figured it out!! Had to include <code>amdgpu</code> in my mkinitcpio.conf file. Never had to do that with the old card but IT WORKS NOW YAY</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PM_ME_SAUSAGES"> /u/PM_ME_SAUSAGES </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyfpyk/gpu_problem_x11_not_starting_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyfpyk/gpu_problem_x11_not_starting_help/">[comments]</a></span>
