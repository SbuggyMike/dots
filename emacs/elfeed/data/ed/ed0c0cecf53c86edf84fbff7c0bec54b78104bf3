An analysis shows that NATO is quite <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/07/14/just-how-much-bigger-us-nato-military-force-russias">capable of defending itself</a> from
any Russian conventional attack.
Bombardment of cities with missiles is the one real threat that
Russia has, and stopping the bombardment might require a
counterinvasion &mdash; but Russia's trying this while fighting in Ukraine
would be suicidal.

I have doubts about whether the various NATO countries could
coordinate well, but their strength may be enough that they could win
anyway.

I think of this as giving the NATO countries space to relax somewhat.
They need to remain strong, but while they do, they are not in great
danger.
