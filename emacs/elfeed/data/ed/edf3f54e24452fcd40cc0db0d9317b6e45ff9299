<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/07/power-and-progress-daron-acemoglu-simon-johnson-review-formidable-demolition-of-the-technology-equals-progress-myth">progressive movement needs to reject the imposed myth</a>
that
technological progress invariably makes people, or society, better
off.  We have the  right to regulate technology for the public good.
<p>
When the users decide what features their technology will have,
they can exclude the features they know they dislike.  But when
companies choose the features and impose them on the users,
they will impose what benefits them, not what benefits the users.
This includes DRM and snooping, as well as
<a href="https://gnu.org/malware/">other nasty things</a>.
  We must demand software be free.
<p>
However, we need to think carefully about what the public good
consists of.  Now that politicians want to "protect children (and
especially tenagers)" by turning the internet into a platform for
repression Ã  la Chinoise, we must insist they do the job in a way
that doesn't make us all politically helpless.
