<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It is very simple, just play when you are mentally of physically exhausted. This will boost your ability to miss easy wins and hang pieces by a lot.</p> <p>You always want your brain to be in suboptimal shape when you play, so the best moments are:</p> <p>1) Play before going to bed, you could not be more tired and your brain just wants to shut down at this point, it is not going to be able to evaluate possible moves after your opponent replies or focus on the board (to save time it is important to plan what move you can play after your opponent).</p> <p>2) Play after losing, because you are now most likely somewhat frustrated or at least a bit disappointed, which kicks you out of the concentrated state you need. Tell yourself that you need to win just one game: this way, the frustration builds up, making it even harder to win just one match, and that requirement will not be met because without your ability to think, you will never be able to beat all those other opponents who are not wanting to smash their keyboard and are actually looking for possible strategies. </p> <p>3) If you are hungry, thirsty or need to go to the toilet, make sure to ignore this, as they are good ways to distract your brain from the game.</p> <p>Whatever you do, make sure to avoid playing chess when you just exercised or took a nap, because you are relaxed, and without any anger &amp; exhaustion interfering with your brain, you are at a much higher risk of not blundering, finding checkmates and your calculations will be much deeper.</p> <p>Now, please go play until you win this night, and you might get a huge streak!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KittenOfHeaven"> /u/KittenOfHeaven </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wfi6s6/easy_guide_on_how_to_lose_a_ton_of_elo_at_chess/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wfi6s6/easy_guide_on_how_to_lose_a_ton_of_elo_at_chess/">[comments]</a></span>
