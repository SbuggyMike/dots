<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. I recently went full switch to Pop OS and I&#39;m loving it so far. Learning a lot as I dial in gaming specifics but I&#39;m also a Freelance Sound Designer. I&#39;ve seen some useful tutorials on how to get what seems like most of my old VSTs to work through Wine staging but I was wondering if there is a way for me to be able to do this for VST companies product portals so I can keep them all up to date and so I can download my plug ins via their respective portals. IZotope being a prime example of what I&#39;m trying to accomplish. Any insight would be great thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dandy_Dan_"> /u/Dandy_Dan_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w1fvzv/izotope_and_vsts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w1fvzv/izotope_and_vsts/">[comments]</a></span>
