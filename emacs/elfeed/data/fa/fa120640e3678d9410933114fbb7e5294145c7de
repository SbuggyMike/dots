  A group of human rights lawyers accuse Turkey of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jul/05/turkey-should-face-international-court-over-yazidi-genocide-report-says-helena-kennedy">complicity in PISSI's
  massacre of Yazidis</a>, and blame Syria and Iraq for failing to prevent the
  massacre.

  They certainly did fail, but I wonder if they could in practice have
  done any better than they actually did.
