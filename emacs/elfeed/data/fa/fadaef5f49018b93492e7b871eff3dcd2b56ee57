<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My xps has a defective cmos battery, after fixing that issue, I had set the time and date again in the bios. My boot sequence was unchanged though.</p> <p>Now Arch won&#39;t boot and gives this error:</p> <p>Error device &#39;PARTUUID=xxx&#39; not found. Skipping fsck.</p> <p>And I get dropped into rootfs. I&#39;m guessing there is a simple way to fix this, I just have troubles finding it.</p> <p>My M.2 boot drive does show up in the BIOS btw.</p> <p>Edit: This &#39;BIOS reset&#39; changed the SATA mode to RAID so arch couldn&#39;t find the proper drive. Just Dell things I guess ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ripirpk"> /u/ripirpk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w166yp/cant_boot_after_bios_reset/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w166yp/cant_boot_after_bios_reset/">[comments]</a></span>
