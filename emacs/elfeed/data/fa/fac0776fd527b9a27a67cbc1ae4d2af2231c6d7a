<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on Windows 11. Emacs installed via Msys2. Everything was working fine for months until about 6 weeks ago. Now my emacs appears to hang when waiting for an external process to respond. I can most consistently repro with M-x package-refresh-contents. My emacs then hangs with the &quot;Importing package-keyring.gpg...&quot; message and never responds. Fortunately, C-g gets it to respond again. Here is my backtrace: </p> <pre><code>epg-wait-for-completion(...) epg--import-keys-1(...) epg-import-keys-from-file(...) package-import-keyring(&quot;c:/msys2/mingw64/share/emacs/28.2/etc/package-keyring.gpg&quot;) package-refresh-contents() </code></pre> <p>This is on my work PC and I thought for sure something must have changed in my environment that&#39;s causing this (even though I haven&#39;t changed anything in my emacs config). I&#39;ve used emacs for years but I&#39;m a novice when it comes to debugging it. After having no luck troubleshooting for hours, I decided to install Msys2 and emacs on my home PC to compare my work PC to a working emacs install. To my surprise, it is broken in the same way on my home PC even after being freshly installed with no custom configuration.</p> <p>Anyone have an idea on what the issue could be?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Impressive_Teacher32"> /u/Impressive_Teacher32 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1318uko/my_emacs_has_been_broken_for_about_6_weeks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1318uko/my_emacs_has_been_broken_for_about_6_weeks/">[comments]</a></span>
