<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Would it be possible to use emacs as a keyboard macro and automation tool outside of emacs.</p> <p>There is things like <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">keyboard maestro</a> for mac or <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">autohotkey</a> that let you create macros and assign them to keys in certain programs. Autohotkey uses an alien syntax and keyboard maestro is mostly mouse based. They are ok but I always wondered if using elisp and emacs would be a more powerful combination. Besides, it would ran on all platforms. Would emacs server be able to do something like this? Anyone ever tried to do something like this?</p> <p>I have never tried EXWM but looking at performance I dont think it would work for me since this is for heavy post production tools.</p> <p>Update: thanks for the Linux suggestions but I am looking for a solution that runs on Mac and Windows mostly since all post production tools widely used run on those.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mamonimoni"> /u/Mamonimoni </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3ajdd/emacs_as_a_keyboard_maestro_or_autohotkey/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3ajdd/emacs_as_a_keyboard_maestro_or_autohotkey/">[comments]</a></span>
