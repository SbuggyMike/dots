<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I am using NVIDIA with all the last proprietary drivers installed, running feral gamemode, disabled my compositor, even tried nvidia-all drivers, using a custom kernel (linux-tkg-pds-5-18) and have a decent card (GTX 1650 Ti + i7 8565U), still get garbage performance, tried it on my friend&#39;s PC who uses an RX 580 4 GB, butter smooth. Is this because NVIDIA is garbage or is there something that I am doing wrong?</p> <p>SOLVED: Installing the nvidia-all 510 package for drivers makes performance awesome. I got this solution from someone in the comments named <a href="/u/mattO_oppreal">u/mattO_oppreal</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/amogusdri-"> /u/amogusdri- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whhfs5/last_call_terrible_performance_on_nvidia/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whhfs5/last_call_terrible_performance_on_nvidia/">[comments]</a></span>
