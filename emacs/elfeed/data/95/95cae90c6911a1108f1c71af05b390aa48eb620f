<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All,</p> <p>I am going to hopefully be attending my first ever proper classical concert (went to see the Boston Pops twice on different occasions, but never Boston Symphony Orchestra) to see my favorite orchestral work, Gustav Holst&#39;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, but I am unsure of some nomenclature and how to look at a performance list. </p> <p>The concert I am considering, The BSO performance on September 22/23, lists &quot;The Planets&quot; as the &quot;showpiece&quot; (I am taking this to mean the &quot;main feature&quot; piece performed last, but please correct me if incorrect), and I would like to verify - does that mean that the WHOLE suite will be performed IN ORDER, if they do not specify specific movements?</p> <p>If it helps, &quot;Bachtrack&quot;, the website which helped me find this performance, lists it as &quot;The Planets Op.32&quot;, which it seems is the identification for the WHOLE work, not one specific movement of it. Is that a good sign that they play the whole suite in order?</p> <p>I very much enjoy the entire work in the order it is numbered, so please forgive me if this is a stupid question - I just want to make sure I am not looking at this upside down or something.</p> <p>Thanks,</p> <p>CT</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chronotides"> /u/Chronotides </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w97ej5/newbie_question_regarding_orchestral_suites_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w97ej5/newbie_question_regarding_orchestral_suites_in/">[comments]</a></span>
