After so many hard years for them for a variety of reasons, these recent results have been amazing.</p> <p>These stats perhaps wouldnt be as impressive for the top batsmen of the too teams, but for a lower tier team have a player have this kind of form really shows in their results. </p> <p>Ironically though, despite all the high scores, Raza has made two ducks which counters their record for a very low duck rate. But for me, the high scores (and winning!) very much make up for it.</p> <p>Go zimzam!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/datu_lapulapu"> /u/datu_lapulapu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/qp7563lrb0g91.jpg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/whdlcf/sikander_razas_purple_patch/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
