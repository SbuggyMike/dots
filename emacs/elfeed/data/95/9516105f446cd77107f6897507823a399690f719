<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Which is better and has more recordings? I just tried IDAGIO and love that you can access the digital booklet of each album just like a CD. However ultimately I am after the biggest repertoire of classical music. Qobuz is not available in my country so thatâ€™s is out of the question and the other steaming services for classical are laughable. Any advice is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chee006"> /u/chee006 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wjrofz/idagio_vs_apple_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wjrofz/idagio_vs_apple_music/">[comments]</a></span>
