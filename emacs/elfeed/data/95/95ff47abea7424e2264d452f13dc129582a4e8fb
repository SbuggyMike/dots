<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am kinda stumped on this problem, and I am hoping someone here can provide some guidance.</p> <p>Booting installation media with UEFI, and when I try to select the option to start the installation the screen goes black and nothing else comes up. On my hard drives I have a broken Ubuntu system and a Windows system that was working until I installed amd graphics drivers for my new gpu. I used an nvidia gpu prior.</p> <p>I initially tried re-installing windows, but the windows installation media does not work either. I had been meaning to install arch back on my pc, so I figured this was a good time. However the arch installation media does not work either.</p> <p>I am aware of the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_parameters#GRUB">grub kernel parameters</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_mode_setting">kernal mode settings</a>, but I do not have much experience with them. It seems people have had this problem <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/f4vjgu/booting_installation_media_usb_results_in_black/">before</a> and the solution is to add &quot;nomodeset&quot; as a kernel parameter. This however does nothing for me. The screen continues to go black after adding new valid and invalid parameters.</p> <p>I have also tried running the installation media with a BIOS boot, but my keyboards do not work in the arch menu for bios boot. I have a fancy keyboard and an old basic keyboard that always works when the fancy one does not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iAlsoAmNotkevinBacon"> /u/iAlsoAmNotkevinBacon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbbzb5/black_screen_after_grub_in_installation_media/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbbzb5/black_screen_after_grub_in_installation_media/">[comments]</a></span>
