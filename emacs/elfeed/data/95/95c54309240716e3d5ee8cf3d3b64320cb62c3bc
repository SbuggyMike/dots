<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On Alpine Linux, I noticed that windowing operations seem almost <em>slow</em> on X11. For example, in KeePassXC, sometimes I can trigger an action that shows a dialog, but then press Enter <em>before the dialog even shows up</em>. But on Windows, the same KeePassXC shows the dialog <em>instantly</em> - so there&#39;s no chance I can accidentally press a key too soon.</p> <p>This raised a question in my mind: is X11 slower than Windows? Is there some secret way to speed it up, or is the architecture just fundamentally slow?</p> <p>I run Xorg with Fluxbox as the window manager and Picom as the compositor. Would any of these be the reason for my observed slowness? Maybe the fact that I only have graphics acceleration on my iGPU, and not my Nvidia GPU?</p> <p>(Bonus: is Wayland faster than X11? I don&#39;t want to use it, because my entire reason for using X11 at the moment is because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/vxqkxo/looking_to_make_an_x11_compositor_like_picom_in/">I want to make a compositor</a>, not an entire desktop environment, but I&#39;m curious anyway.)</p> <p>Note that this isn&#39;t a support request - I&#39;d rather discuss if there&#39;s something up with X11&#39;s architecture that would make it fundamentally incapable of surpassing Windows&#39; performance. Like how everything uses network connections to localhost...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LoganDark"> /u/LoganDark </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w15h56/is_x11_slower_than_windows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w15h56/is_x11_slower_than_windows/">[comments]</a></span>
