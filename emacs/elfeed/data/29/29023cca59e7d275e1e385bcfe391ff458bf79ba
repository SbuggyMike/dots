<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am 100% all for marketing Division one of the Championship as the elite, pump some money in, call it the Premier League, give them an extra overseas player, schedule it so the Roots and Stokes of the world are available for a good chunk of it and make it the place every player aspires to play.</p> <p>What I can’t get my head around is this idea of closing it off. We’ve got this drive going on for more inclusivity and you want to close off the championship to all but 12 teams, it’s ridiculous.</p> <p>Promotion and relegation should be fundamental in any frame work going forward, players have genuine affinity to their counties. Who’s telling Ben Stokes he has to leave Durham?</p> <p>I’ve always been a big proponent of opening the game, I think only certain teams being able to play test matches is dumb, anyone should be able to play whatever they want and it’s the same for this situation.</p> <p>I’d go further too, have promotion and relegation between division 2 and the national counties, that would unlock the door to opening cricket to the entire country, everyone has something to aim for, no one feels like they’re at a dead end and anyone born anywhere knows they can fight for the chance of being a first class cricketer.</p> <p>Having something to aspire too will create more top quality cricketers than having the limited opportunity of a 12 team top division.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NiallH22"> /u/NiallH22 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wfjpkl/the_rumour_of_the_county_championship_being/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wfjpkl/the_rumour_of_the_county_championship_being/">[comments]</a></span>
