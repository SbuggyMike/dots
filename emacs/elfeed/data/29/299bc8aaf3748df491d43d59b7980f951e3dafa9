<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been a month since the last disk image release of Rolling Rhino Remix. The development team has worked hard to squash issues in this release as well as improve the quality of life for the user.</p> <p>Rolling Rhino Remix 2022.08.01 ships with the 5.18.15 kernel by default. The initialisation tool has now been deprecated, with the disk images being built handling the tasks the rhino-init tool previously handled. All packages have also been upgraded to their latest version and there have been a number of small bug fixes.</p> <p><strong>Release announcement:</strong> <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/blog/#2022-07-01">https://rollingrhino.org/blog/#2022-07-01</a> </p> <p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/download">https://rollingrhino.org/download</a> </p> <p><strong>Contact (Discord, Matrix and Email):</strong> <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/contact">https://rollingrhino.org/contact</a></p> <p><strong>Donate (Liberapay):</strong> <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/donate">https://rollingrhino.org/donate</a></p> <p>Thank you for reading :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MrBeeBenson"> /u/MrBeeBenson </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wdsspn/rolling_rhino_remix_20220801_release/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wdsspn/rolling_rhino_remix_20220801_release/">[comments]</a></span>
