<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I (roughly 1000 Elo in Bullet, Blitz, and Rapid) have my Bullet settings set at +/- 200 but I routinely get my face caved in by players within my Bullet challenge settings but with, e.g., 1800+ Rapid Elo. Is there a way to limit the Rapid rating of my opponents when Iâ€™m playing Bullet?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/green_desk"> /u/green_desk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbpj7n/chesscom_custom_challenge_settings/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbpj7n/chesscom_custom_challenge_settings/">[comments]</a></span>
