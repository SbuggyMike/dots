<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have 2 seperate animations that I want to play while my PC is starting: one during boot and one just before or just after the display manager login. I have already figured out the boot animation using Plymouth, but I can&#39;t seem to get the other animation working. Does anybody know how this can be done? I prefer if the animation is played just before the login, however it would also work if it&#39;s played like a KDE splash screen after login.</p> <p>Note: This must work on Arch and it shouldn&#39;t depend on a specific desktop environment.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/victorfloyd"> /u/victorfloyd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w80308/splash_screen_animation_on_arch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w80308/splash_screen_animation_on_arch/">[comments]</a></span>
