<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I came across a severe issue that prevented me from installing Arch on any virtual machines. Upon using pacstrap, everything seems fine until the installer starts to try to verify the PGP signatures. After some time it returns something like: &quot;Fine /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg/libcap-2.65.1.x86_64.pkg.tar.zst is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature))&quot;, after which pacstrap refuses to install the rest of the packages for reasons. This essentially renders me unable to install the rest of the system. How do I fix this? (Running the July 7 archiso) I can provide more information if needed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PKSonikal"> /u/PKSonikal </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w98jfk/helpinvalid_or_corrupt_package_pgp_signature_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w98jfk/helpinvalid_or_corrupt_package_pgp_signature_on/">[comments]</a></span>
