Georgia <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> outdid themselves in defying reality and stretching
laws by
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/05/02/cop-city-activists-arrest-flyers/">arresting activists who were putting flyers</a>
on mailboxes.
  They gave the address of one of the <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> who was involved in <a href="/archives/2023-jan-apr.html#11_February_2023_(Killed_protester_maybe_innocent,_US)">killing
protester Manuel Paez Ter√°n</a>
   in the forest which is to be cut down to build Cop City.
<p>
*The inquiry into [his] death has been marred by
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/04/cop-city-atlanta-manuel-paez-teran-death-autopsy">contradictory information released by officials</a>.*
<p>
I hazard a guess that the <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> and judges involved in this are
right-wing.  Contempt for law, justice and truth is the hallmark of
the right wing, and these look like examples of it.
