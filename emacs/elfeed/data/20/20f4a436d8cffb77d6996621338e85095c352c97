Graham Mansfield was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/20/manchester-man-on-trial-for-ill-wifes-says-she-asked-him-to-kill-her">tried for murder</a> after killing his wife, Dyanne,
who in great pain from terminal cancer and made him promise to end her
suffering.  Then he tried to kill himself, but he couldn't go through with it.

I read that he was acquitted of murder.  I hope they do not punish
him.  Staying alive without his dearest is a terrible punishment.
