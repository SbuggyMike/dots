<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to write some exotic characters, like ĵ, ĉ or ŭ. I am using a qwerty US keyboard layout on a GNU linux machine, and I set up my compose key with <code>setxkbmap -layout us -option compose:ralt</code>. This works flawlessly almost everywhere, including when using Emacs from a terminal with <code>emacs -q -nw</code>. I can write words like &quot;ĵaŭdo&quot; (&quot;thursday&quot; in Esperanto), no problem at all.</p> <p>But when I try to input the compose sequence corresponding to one of those characters using Emacs in GUI mode with <code>emacs -q</code>, nothing happens. Clearly, Emacs GUI understands my compose key, as I can use it to write french characters like &quot;déjà&quot;. Furthermore, it does not seem to be a character set issue: If I write &quot;ĵaŭdo&quot; in a text file, and open this file from Emacs GUI, it renders those characters just fine. Does anybody know what is going here? (<code>emacs --version</code> GNU Emacs 28.1`)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chpill"> /u/chpill </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb8qcg/weird_behavior_in_emacs_gui_when_using_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb8qcg/weird_behavior_in_emacs_gui_when_using_linux/">[comments]</a></span>
