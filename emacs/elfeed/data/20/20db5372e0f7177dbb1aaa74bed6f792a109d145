Some time ago I started to weigh myself every day. Some people argue that this is a bad idea and you should weigh yourself once per week to avoid worrying about random fluctuations. I disagree – the way not to worry about random fluctuations is to look at moving averages instead, Hacker's Diet-style. Note: I do not necessarily endorse Hacker’s Diet as a whole, but the moving average approach is certainly a good one. For the sake of simplicity, I am going to use simple (unweighted) moving averages over one week. I want to keep my weight data in an Org mode table (obviously).
