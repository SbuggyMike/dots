<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I thought that I would share five pieces that introuduced me to classical music. I hope that this guide is useful for others who are just starting to listen to classical music or want to know where to start.</p> <ol> <li>Mendelssohn - The Hebrides Overture, op. 26: This is one of the first orchestral pieces I got into. I loved the use of different orchestral instruments present in this piece (especially the clarinet solo when the second theme returns) and how Mendelssohn was essentially able to paint a picture of Fingal&#39;s Cave. This piece is absolutely beautiful and is definitely worth a listen.</li> <li>Beethoven - Symphony No. 7 in A Major, op. 92: This is my favourite Beethoven symphony out of all nine. The first movement&#39;s introduction with its rising scales is such a great way to start the symphony, which is followed by joyous themes dominated by a rhythmic ostinato throughout. The second movement, which is probably the most famous movement of this symphony, is also very beautiful and eventually builds up to a powerful climax where the main theme is played by the full orchestra.</li> <li>Mendelssohn - Violin Concerto in E Minor, op. 64: Perhaps the most famous violin concerto of all time, this is truly an epic work. The first movement with its &quot;E minor mood&quot; opens with one of the most famous violin melodies but quickly transitions into a lyrical second theme played by the winds. The way that the cadenza seamlessly transitions back into the recapitulation is also notable. The second movement provides some lyrical relief of the energy of the first movement, which is then proceeded by a very spirited and fanfarous finale.</li> <li>Beethoven - Piano Sonata in C Minor, op. 13 &quot;Pathetique&quot;: This sonata in particular helped spark my interest to listen to the other Beethoven sonatas, all of which are great works. This is one of the first classical pieces that I listened to, and the warm second movement in particular is so expressive and has one of the most beautiful melodies of classical music.</li> <li>Bach - Prelude and Fugue in C Minor, BWV 847: This is often one of the first Preludes and Fugues that students learn when studying Bach. Before listening to this piece, I always thought that Baroque music was too complex and uninteresting, but this piece changed my mind on Baroque music. The harmonies of the prelude captured my attention, and the way that the fugue ties itself together made me appreciate Baroque polyphony more.</li> </ol> <p>As one who has been learning piano and violin since a young age, I have always been surrounded by classical music but haven&#39;t truly appreciated it until I discovered these five pieces. If anyone else wants to share the first pieces that got them into the world of classical music, please do so below. Additionally, if anyone who is new to listening to classical music would like some suggestions, I would definitely check out the ones that I listed if you haven&#39;t already.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/violinist0"> /u/violinist0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/138yqhe/five_pieces_that_introduced_me_to_classical_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/138yqhe/five_pieces_that_introduced_me_to_classical_music/">[comments]</a></span>
