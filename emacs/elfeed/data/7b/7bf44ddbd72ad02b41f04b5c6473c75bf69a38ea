<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To start things off, I&#39;m a linux noob. Never used it before, I thought it was all just Ubuntu, kinda like how there was Windows 7, then 10, 11, etc. (We don&#39;t talk about 8). But my wife&#39;s old laptop she used for college was starting to show its age. Booting up took ages and took even longer just to right click on desktop. It was some crappy Dell laptop that had crap specs even when it released, and when the hard drive started failing I knew Win11 wasn&#39;t really a choice. So, guess it&#39;s time to throw on Linux Ubuntu, right? </p> <p>Googled and went right down the rabbit hole of what the whole Linux ecosystem is. Ubuntu is just one distro, and there&#39;s at least thousands of them. Oh god there&#39;s a lot. But most all of them are free! Spent a weekend googling until I finally settled on Zorin OS: good for newbies, looks like Windows. Perfect.</p> <p>Installed on an ssd after some wrestling with it (turns out most people test distros on a VM first before installing. Whoops. Also if you choose try zorin instead of install, it&#39;ll let you &quot;try it&quot; sure, but the installer on the desktop won&#39;t actually do anything. I had to both reflash the usb and reformat the drive to &quot;reset&quot; the whole thing).</p> <p>Omg you guys I really should have switched sooner! Firefox - already there. Office - already there. An old printer that I had to specifically hunt down a separate driver for on Windows - automatically connected. What! The laptop supports touchscreen, screen rotating, and tablet mode, all of which which Windows &#39;is supposed to support&#39; but never actually did, Zorin pulled off seamlessly. App store is amazing! Click on a button and Inkscape is already installed! Incredible. </p> <p>Applause to folks at Zorin and their work making this available FOR FREE. Is it lightning fast? Nah, it still hangs a bit, but only a bit and is 100% better than Win10 taking forever to do anything. I&#39;ve never had to touch the terminal this entire time. Zorin just does it. </p> <p>Now I know why you Linux folks are singing its praises and I&#39;ll join you in spreading the word!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thienan567"> /u/Thienan567 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wggfmi/linux_just_saved_an_old_laptop_never_thought_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wggfmi/linux_just_saved_an_old_laptop_never_thought_it/">[comments]</a></span>
