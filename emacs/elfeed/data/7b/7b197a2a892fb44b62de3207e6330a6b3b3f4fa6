<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for one specific piece- </p> <p>Title: Duo For Guitar &amp; Harpe</p> <p>Artist: William Lawes (1602-1645)</p> <p>I have scoured the internet and theres not even one youtube video or audio file with this name. I&#39;ve come across some other pieces by William Lawes that sound similar with different tittles but I can&#39;t tell if its the same because all I have to go off is one 13 second audio clip that the radio station I originally listened to had and I am not musically inclined.</p> <p>Please help me. It was one of the most beautifully calming pieces I have ever listened to and I really want to hear it in full again.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WhatsMyAccordion"> /u/WhatsMyAccordion </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8qr2g/where_to_find_classical_music_to_download/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8qr2g/where_to_find_classical_music_to_download/">[comments]</a></span>
