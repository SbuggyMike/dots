<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We recently held <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w1bmtw/meta_a_community_vote_on_the_spoiler_rule/">a community vote</a> on whether or not to continue having a spoilers rule. The results were as follow:</p> <ul> <li>318 votes on &quot;Keep the spoiler rule as is&quot;</li> <li>223 votes on &quot;Keep the spoiler rule and modify it according to community wishes&quot;</li> <li><strong>555 votes on &quot;Remove the spoiler rule entirely&quot;</strong></li> </ul> <p>As such, we&#39;ll respect the wishes of the majority and effective immediately spoilers are no longer a part of our rules.</p> <p>Just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/rifrz6/rule_clarifications_on_birthday_posts_sitebased/">like we did with birthday posts though</a>, post-game/match threads will require a minimum level of effort so that it&#39;s not about whoever first makes a picture only post or a one sentence only text post announcing a result.</p> <p>Moving forward post-game threads will require:</p> <ul> <li>Informative, descriptive titles. Not your opinion, just the facts.</li> <li>In the body of post or in a comment: <ul> <li>The result of the game</li> <li>The game itself. You can include it in algebraic notation as plain text, you can wrap it in <code>[pgn][/pgn]</code> tags to be read by the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1s8j14/inline_pgn_viewer_faq/">Reddit PGN Viewer browser add-on</a> or link to the game in a website such as Lichess, chess24, chessgames.com, etc.</li> </ul></li> <li>If the result you are announcing is the result of a game(s) involving other players (ie: Player 1 winning the candidates as a result of players 2 and 3 making a draw), describe that situation and include <em>that</em> game.</li> <li>If the result was announced in a chess news outlet (via social media, or their own website), please link to that.</li> <li>If the result was announced on a live broadcast/stream, please link to it.</li> <li>If it&#39;s a post-tournament thread it should include standings in lieu of a game</li> </ul> <p>Hopefully these requirements will increase the informative value of such posts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/atopix"> /u/atopix </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/willv9/we_no_longer_have_a_rule_on_spoilers_for_game_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/willv9/we_no_longer_have_a_rule_on_spoilers_for_game_and/">[comments]</a></span>
