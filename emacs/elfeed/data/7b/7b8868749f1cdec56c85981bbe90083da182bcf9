He paid 66p for the two We played them and the dynamics were extreme We could hardly hear the quiets and the louds were cutting off but otherwise the quality was not bad We looked them up and there&#39;s a sparcely populated discogs page but otherwise these have no Internet presence at all Are they legitimate? Has anyone heard of Emperor? Who are these mystery Germans? Help from any Symphony Sherlocks would be appreciated</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wiggienengit"> /u/wiggienengit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/wahjnk">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wahjnk/can_anyone_solve_a_musical_mystery/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
