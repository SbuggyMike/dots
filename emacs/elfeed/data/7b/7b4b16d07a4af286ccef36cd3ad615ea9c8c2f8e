<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a PC primarily built for VR. Currently I am running windows on it as I have yet to sink my teeth into linux. I am wondering, if it is reasonable to switch this PC to Linux if it&#39;s primary purpose is VR I am not comfortable with command line interface, though that may come with practice. The system is CPU 5600X and GPU 6700XT. The VR set is a Valve index. I primarily play beatsaber and half-life Alyx. Is there a more newb friendly path for me to take, or should I just stick with windows for now?</p> <p>EDIT Thank you everyone for your input. I have decided to shelve this project for now maybe take it back up in the winter when I do play more VR. It seems to be very luck of the draw as far as I can tell and require some work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cuddle_X_Fish"> /u/Cuddle_X_Fish </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w21bbk/how_is_vr_on_linux_today/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w21bbk/how_is_vr_on_linux_today/">[comments]</a></span>
