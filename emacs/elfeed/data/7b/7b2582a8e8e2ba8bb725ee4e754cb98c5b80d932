<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/sanctions-against-russia-are-not-backfiring">Are economic sanctions against Russia worth while</a>, if they don't help make
Putin drop the attempt to conquer Ukraine?
<p>
I support showing solidarity with Ukraine, but I contend that the best
ways to do that are the ways that re effective help.  Giving Ukraine
arms to defeat and repel the <a href="/glossary.html#putinforces">Putin forces</a> is effective, while economic
warfare through sanctions seems to be backfiring.  Thus, I suggest we
do more of the former and less of the latter.
