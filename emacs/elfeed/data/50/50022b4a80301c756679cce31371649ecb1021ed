<p>
I have been disappointed with Feinstein for years because she is a
so-called
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2018-mar-jun.html#6_May_2018_('New_Democrats')">"centrist" (that is, plutocratist) Democrat</a>.
However. the reason there is a campaign for her to resign now is that her illness
and consequent inability to vote in the senate is <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2023-jan-apr.html#21_April_2023_(Judicial_appointments_blocked)">blocking Biden's
  judicial appointments</a>.
If she resigns, the governor of California
will appoint another Democrat who will be physically well and able to vote.
