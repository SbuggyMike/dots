<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My workflow uses an e-ink tablet for reading (textbooks) and rough note taking (lectures, exercises). My rough notes sync from my e-ink device to my laptop, where I use Obsidian to transform my e-ink notes into more fleshed out notes (Evergreen notes).</p> <p>I like being outside and work/study from different places and one hurdle I run into is I don’t have a way of accessing my nice fleshed out Obsidian notes on my e-ink device. Usually I have to have my laptop/phone next to me and reference my notes from there, which is not ideal. </p> <p>Now, this has me wondering if I can warrant myself switching to emacs and org to have my computer notes (org files) easily accessible on my e-ink device. </p> <p>I have been doing a bit of searching and I guess org-publish and then accessing a website on my e-ink device could work. Perhaps mass exporting all my .org files as pdfs/epubs and then syncing them to my e-ink device. (I don’t know if that method could keep backlinks)</p> <p>But as I have never used org and this is just my speculation I came here to ask: Is this feasible? Do any of you have a similar setup? </p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pacco911"> /u/Pacco911 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12zbic4/emacs_orgmodeorgroam_workflow_with_eink_devices/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12zbic4/emacs_orgmodeorgroam_workflow_with_eink_devices/">[comments]</a></span>
