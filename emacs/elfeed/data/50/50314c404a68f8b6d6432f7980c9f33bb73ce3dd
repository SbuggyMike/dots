<p>Michał Sapka has an interesting post that serves as a nice coda to <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/">yesterday’s post</a> on Emacs integrating so many productivity tools. One of those tools is the RSS feed reader, Chris Wellons’ <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">Elfeed</a>.</p>
<p>Sapka’s post is about his <a href="https://d-s.sh/2023/moving-my-rss-reading-to-emacs-with-elfeed/">moving to Elfeed</a> for his RSS feeds. His move is in the context of a larger migration from dedicated packages to those integrated with Emacs. Elfeed needs no justification other than its own excellence. It is, by far, the best RSS reader I have ever used and the fact that it operates under Emacs is just a bonus. You can check Sapka’s post for some of the things he likes about it but the TL;DR is that it’s simple and includes images when appropriate.</p>
<p>Contra Google, RSS is an important tool for many of us and having a first class reader integrated into our editor of choice is a huge win. FortunateDaughter_ from yesterday’s post, wonders if it’s worth it for users to prefer Emacs integrated apps in preference to dedicated applications performing the same functions. The unstated implication is that these dedicated applications are better. Elfeed puts the lie to that. It is, in my opinion, the best RSS reader at the same time it’s integrated into Emacs. It turns out that, sometimes at least, you can have it all.</p>
