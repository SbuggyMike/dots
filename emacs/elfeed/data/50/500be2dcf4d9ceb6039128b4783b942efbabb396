Happy to announce its first versioned release! To re-iterate its objectives:</p> <ol> <li>Provides a solid, ootb workflow for task and project management.</li> <li>Pre-configured for Julia and python programming - supports both REPL and notebook based workflows.</li> <li>Ideal for users looking to &#39;try emacs&#39;. It can be used as-is by setting only a handful of (including zero) parameters.</li> <li>May interest &#39;experienced&#39; elisp novices and/or emacs novices &#39;looking to get serious&#39;. The code is amply commented, and package configurations are as decoupled as possile. Perfect to learn how to write elisp and how to configure some of the more commonly-used packages.</li> </ol> <p>Give it a go! All user feedback and contributions are welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cellular--automaton"> /u/cellular--automaton </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wdh64r/emacsgroundup_first_tagged_release/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wdh64r/emacsgroundup_first_tagged_release/">[comments]</a></span>
