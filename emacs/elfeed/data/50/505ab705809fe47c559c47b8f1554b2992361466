<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi!</p> <p>I am trying to forget about standard terminal emulators, and to work 100% in emacs.</p> <p>how shall I open files when I am working in vterm. In my regular terminal emulator (alacritty), I would edit the files with emacsclient. but how when I am already in vterm in emacs?</p> <p>How you people do in that case? Open another emacsclient instance from within vterm?</p> <p>Thanks for sharing</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fmou67"> /u/fmou67 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132wefk/how_to_open_a_file_when_i_am_working_in_vterm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132wefk/how_to_open_a_file_when_i_am_working_in_vterm/">[comments]</a></span>
