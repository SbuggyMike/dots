<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just switched from Windows 10 last week and haven&#39;t had many problems besides this one which I have tried to solve with the things I found online and by my own ways and I can&#39;t figure it out, this just seems like the best place to ask because I am still new to linux so I&#39;m unfamiliar with a lot of things.</p> <p>I am running it using GE-Proton7.55 which worked perfectly for me previously, but no longer works. I have also tried using Proton 8.0 and 7.0 but neither of those work.</p> <p>I noticed this issue about 2 days ago when I tried to launch the game and it would just go black after the main loading screen had completed. I thought that it could have been something that updated or installed so I checked through the pacman log and removed all the packages I had installed in the past few days to no avail. After that I left it alone for a few days while I worked on some other things, but I thought it would be a good idea to try installing to a different SSD and seeing if that solved the problem. I just did the fresh install on that SSD and had the same exact issue.</p> <p>I attached a screenshot of the clean install I just made which is running the same DE as my main drive, it only has a handful of packages I manually installed just to get steam up and running, other than that its just the firmware and default Plasma KDE install.</p> <p>Specs</p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZzNq72x">https://imgur.com/a/ZzNq72x</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hunter1q1"> /u/hunter1q1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13028xj/black_ops_3_running_fine_a_few_days_ago_now_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13028xj/black_ops_3_running_fine_a_few_days_ago_now_it/">[comments]</a></span>
