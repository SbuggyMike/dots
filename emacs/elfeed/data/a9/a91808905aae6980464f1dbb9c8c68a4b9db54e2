<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;ve recently moved from Cinnamon to i3wm and I am quite happy with this, except for Pycharm, that is quite terrible on the WM, so I am giving a try to emacs and I started with Doom. However, there is very little documentation on how to setup it in a way that it is comparable with Pycharm in usability, so I am wondering if you could point me in a direction on how to do that. Besides, there are some other problems that I am facing: - How do you setup and use python environments on emacs? I tried poetry, but it doesn&#39;t have anyway to inherit global site packages. There are many packages that I installed globally as I will always use them, so I don&#39;t want to keep reinstalling them in every environment. - I see nowhere a place to run and debug my python scripts and see the results. Also, after everything is setup will it be able to show graphs and images? - Treemacs always open in the .doom.d directory how can I make it open in my home directory?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/arivar"> /u/arivar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w7a2hz/programming_in_python/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w7a2hz/programming_in_python/">[comments]</a></span>
