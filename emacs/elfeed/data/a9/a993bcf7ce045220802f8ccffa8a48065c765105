In an arid land city, a rich person can use <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/10/swimming-pools-rich-driving-city-water-crises">almost ten times as much
    water</a> as a poor person.
  Cities head towards a water shortage should
strictly limit water consumption by the rich years before what they
would call a "crisis".
<p>
Private wells also deplete the same ground water that makes up the
last resort for the region.  They should be strictly regulated.
<p>
By contrast, building private desalinization plants run by renewable
energy should be encouraged, because they increase the total water
resources available to the region and don't take it away from anyone
else.
