<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I decided about two weeks ago I was finally sick of having Windows on my computer. I was trying to edit together a video and I couldn&#39;t get my microphone drivers to work. They would cut audio randomly while I was recording. The system was running very poorly on my older gaming PC. I intend to upgrade the hardware in the future but I mostly play older/low graphic games anyways so it&#39;s not a big deal to me. I also manually disabled a ton of Windows bloat that were leading to annoying issues like a &quot;nag&quot; message to reinstall the Windows Gaming overlay for example.</p> <p>I decided to go with the Cinnamon Mint distro. It was a super easy install. I honestly expected it to be a little more... uhh... complicated? I can&#39;t speak for everyone but I found flashing the usb and installing it to be really simple. The only hang up I had was right before I attempted to install it I lost power for a day. Substation in my town blew out. Most people are saying it was the AC&#39;s running on a hot day, but I think it was the raw power of Linux back feeding into it. Hard to say, but I&#39;m no electrician after all.</p> <p>I planned my switch pretty carefully. I backed up everything important and went into Linux with an open mind and a plan to start using the open source software. I wanted to make sure I didn&#39;t have any compatibility issues and the best way to overcome that was just to use the software available to me in the repositories. I found everything I needed there pretty easily. I downloaded Steam and tested the games I wanted to keep playing. They all ran smooth as butter.</p> <p>Since I was having so much fun and I had everything set up on my gaming pc, I had another idea. I dusted off my old Chromebook I&#39;d left for junk a few months ago. The poor thing was on it&#39;s last legs, no more updates from Google and the battery life was a joke.I remembered that I saw a YouTube video where someone installed Linux on their Chromebook so I decided to give it a shot. I opened her up, pulled out the screw that disabled the read/write on the Chromebook and flashed the MrChomeBox bootloader on to my Chromebook. I was also able to easily get Cinnamon Mint working and I&#39;m writing this post from that same Chromebook right now.</p> <p>Yes, my old baby from 2017 is back alive again and with some tweaking I&#39;ve managed to get everything running on it pretty damn well with a few exceptions. The battery needs to be replaced. That should be simple and not really a software related issue. The only software issue I ran into was the sound drivers don&#39;t work at all. I&#39;m still troubleshooting the problem but I have a work around. I just use my bluetooth speaker and the audio plays fine through there. Troubleshooting this issue is giving me an opportunity to mess around with the terminal a lot too and it&#39;s been so much fun.</p> <p>I honestly feel like a kid again. Computers had become a function of life instead of a playground like they used to be for me when I was younger. I loved messing around with my old Windows 95 pc and playing in dos always felt so cool to me. I&#39;m really happy I made the choice to switch to Linux and I look very forward to learning more and more about it.</p> <p>Here&#39;s a screenshot of my <a href="https://ibb.co/WGKcb2K">neofetch and my desktop</a>. I know it&#39;s not for everyone but the partially transparent windows are really doing it for me üòÅ</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/4672656542656572"> /u/4672656542656572 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wj3ha4/switching_to_linux_has_been_the_most_fun_ive_had/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wj3ha4/switching_to_linux_has_been_the_most_fun_ive_had/">[comments]</a></span>
