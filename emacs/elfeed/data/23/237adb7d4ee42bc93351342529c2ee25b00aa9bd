<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Got my first IT job offer. I have zero professional IT experience. I do have a few certs. What set me apart was on my resume that I put use Linux as a daily driving OS.</p> <p>Keep in mind this job HAS NOTHING to do with Linux at all.</p> <p>We go through the interview, I struggled with parts then he asked &quot;You use linux as your main operating system at home?&quot; I go &quot;yea&quot;. He flips his monitor around and asks me to complete some fairly trivial basic tasks. He was running Kali. </p> <ul> <li>I had to install a program</li> <li>I had to uninstall the program</li> <li>I had to use a few tools on a website he gave me</li> <li>I had to show I know basic commands of navigating around the CLI</li> </ul> <p>I do those really basic tasks and then I ask &quot;Will I be working on Linux in this job?&quot; and he goes &quot;In this role? No you won&#39;t be we don&#39;t use it here&quot; </p> <p>I recently got the job offer, and I was told the thing that set me apart from the other candidates was that I can use Linux. Correct the job literally has NOTHING to do with Linux at all. However he said the fact that I use Linux indicates to him I have the ability to teach myself anything that I need to learn to do the job.</p> <p><strong>edit</strong></p> <p>It was a VM install. I suspect he set it up for the interview. He was not daily driving Kali. All PCs in this place are using windows</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/redditadmindumb87"> /u/redditadmindumb87 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whejda/me_knowing_linux_helped_me_land_a_job_that_has/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whejda/me_knowing_linux_helped_me_land_a_job_that_has/">[comments]</a></span>
