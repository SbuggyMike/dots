<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It seems the fans on my RX6700 aren&#39;t spinning. Psensor reports 0RPM on the fans, and 102C on the GPU. Is there a way I can force them to spin? amdguid and amdgpu-fan don&#39;t seem to be working (or I&#39;m doing it wrong, which is entirely possible).</p> <p>When I&#39;m running Far Cry 6, everything is fine, and all of the sudden I get like 5 FPS, and it&#39;s clear something is really struggling. My CPU averages 65-70C, but the utilization jumps from 60% down to 25% when this happens, so maybe it&#39;s a CPU thing (i7-6800k), but with GPU temps that high, I have to wonder if it&#39;s a GPU thing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vwagenjetta"> /u/vwagenjetta </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5dofa/rx6700_fans_not_spinning/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5dofa/rx6700_fans_not_spinning/">[comments]</a></span>
