<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>While listening to a &quot;Recent Releases&quot; playlist on Spotify I found myself curious about one of the recordings and wondered what else might be on the album. When I clicked on it I realized it was a Single and there wasn&#39;t an album at all. While this is very common with pop music I&#39;ve just begun to notice it in the classical sphere.</p> <p>Personally, I think it makes a lot of sense, especially for soloists or small ensembles as they can just record a single piece and release it without having to worry about gathering enough material for an entire album. Less studio time, less production time, less cost. It really shows how digital has transformed the industry.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lorum_ipsum_dolor"> /u/lorum_ipsum_dolor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wbai3i/the_emergence_of_classical_singles_recordings/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wbai3i/the_emergence_of_classical_singles_recordings/">[comments]</a></span>
