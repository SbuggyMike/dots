<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I fear for the future of New Zealand cricket. </p> <p>Not for the future of the teams, or even the board, but I fear that franchise-ification &amp; the curtailing of international cricket (the so-called &quot;Football/Basketball Model&quot;) will <strong>destroy</strong> New Zealand cricket &amp; lead to its effective death, just as NZ cricket has got into a position where it&#39;s not treated as a worthless minnow. I should add that this is not unique to New Zealand, but to all smaller Full Members. </p> <p>New Zealand, like most smaller FMs, makes more money from white ball bilaterals than Tests or domestic/league cricket. To accept the reduction or even elimination of our main money makers that draw the biggest crowds, to accept the financial hole that it would create, is something that needs to be comprehended. </p> <p>Now, some could make the suggestion that the solution to that is to go &quot;full football&quot; &amp; set up a T20 league to make up that money. For some others, it could work, but any logical assessment of the NZ cricket position would show that a franchise league would be a failure for New Zealand</p> <ul> <li>smallest population of an ICC FM;</li> <li>not a rich board that can afford a glitzy franchise league;</li> <li>a NZ league (if placed where Super Smash is in late November- January) would be competing against several other leagues for attention, overseas stars &amp; money;</li> <li>New Zealand&#39;s small domestic market means that it can&#39;t rely on a domestic audience to make money, &amp; being in a bad time zone for international audiences hobbles them a lot;</li> </ul> <p>NZC has (very wisely) refused to go along the franchise route, or even separating T20 from the other domestic formats or the domestic structure. What that also means is that with a reduced role for international cricket, NZC won&#39;t be able to fund the system that is producing what we have now. It would reduce NZ to a minnow, even worse than we were throughout our history. </p> <p>In short, as far as I see it, the reduction of international cricket as well as franchise-ification of cricket <em>represents an existential threat to New Zealand as a cricketing nation, certainly the end of New Zealand as any kind of force in world cricket</em>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RMTBolton"> /u/RMTBolton </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wclp9d/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wclp9d/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/">[comments]</a></span>
