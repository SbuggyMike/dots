<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Every so often I need to do some type of data processing where strings (mutable or not) with text properties, as in Emacs, would be the perfect tool.</p> <p>So, are there packages in other programming languages that provide a &quot;string with text properties&quot; data structure?
