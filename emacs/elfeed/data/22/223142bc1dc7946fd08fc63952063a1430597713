The inspector general of the Department of Hostility and Sadism knew for months
that some important Jan 6 messages <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/07/29/records-show-there-are-more-missing-jan-6-texts-dhs-watchdog-failed-mention">had been deleted</a>, and did not tell Congress.
The missing (deleted) messages extend beyond the Secret Service;
some involved the highest officials of the DHS.
