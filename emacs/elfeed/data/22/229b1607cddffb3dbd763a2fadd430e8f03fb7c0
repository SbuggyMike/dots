Biden broke a commitment that the US would <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/biden-breaks-major-g7-climate-promise-by-financing-indonesian-oil-refinery">stop financing fossil fuel
    development in other countries</a>.

It is silly to claim that Indonesia will refine fuel in the expanded
Balikpapan refinery instead of refining fuel elsewhere and importing
the results.  The owners of the other refineries will try to sell
their output somewhere else.
