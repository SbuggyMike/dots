<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not sure if anyone realizes it exists...it gets a decent amount of hits but the subreddit is pretty quiet. Seems like a solid distro, just doesn&#39;t have the community of something like Endeavour or Garuda, but it works, it&#39;s clean, and it&#39;s the source of the fairly cool Arch Tweak Tool. Maybe it&#39;s just that the dev bills it as an educational thing rather than a &quot;real&quot; distro to be used? Don&#39;t know. Thought I&#39;d ask The Internet. </p> <p>I&#39;m not associated with the project, just a fan of Arch variants.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/npaladin2000"> /u/npaladin2000 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w5ed67/seems_like_arcolinux_doesnt_get_much_love/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w5ed67/seems_like_arcolinux_doesnt_get_much_love/">[comments]</a></span>
