<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a way to play long time controls online, preferably 60 minutes to 90 minutes. I believe this will help me improve rapidly. </p> <p>Online chess is hard to find people willing to play even 30 minute games. If anyone is interested or know any groups please let me know. Looking for players in the 2000 range.</p> <p>Send me a dm if you are interested.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Independent_Cut_5576"> /u/Independent_Cut_5576 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbnbz0/expert_player_looking_for_opponent_to_play_long/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbnbz0/expert_player_looking_for_opponent_to_play_long/">[comments]</a></span>
