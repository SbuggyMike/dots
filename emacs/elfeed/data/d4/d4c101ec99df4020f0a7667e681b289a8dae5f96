<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>My university didn&#39;t have any Linux or FOSS related clubs, so I kinda ended up founding one. But after almost a year of club establishment, I&#39;ve realized that people (here uni students) don&#39;t really care about Linux or FOSS. Even though they use FOSS programs or services, they don&#39;t know or don&#39;t want to know more.</p> <p>Furthermore, we don&#39;t have enough members or activity. I thought maybe managing a wiki for students might help. But I couldn&#39;t find free hosting that also allows for some control over who can edit (like limiting it to .edu emails).</p> <p>So thinking maybe other people have more ideas, or there are other Linux related clubs from other universities that we can collaborate with, I&#39;m posting this.</p> <p>Some ideas that I have, but we don&#39;t have many man power to do it: - Maintain a wiki with Linux+FOSS things for students, - Encourage contributions to open source, - Encourage publishing term-projects and other projects with open source license in cloud, - Maybe somehow connect contributions to volunteer hours that other clubs do for physical volunteer activities, etc.</p> <p>Also, what do you people think would interest students that haven&#39;t heard about Linux or only heard the stereotype to be interested.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thevoidzero"> /u/thevoidzero </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13if1nq/ideas_for_activities_for_a_university_linux_club/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13if1nq/ideas_for_activities_for_a_university_linux_club/">[comments]</a></span>
