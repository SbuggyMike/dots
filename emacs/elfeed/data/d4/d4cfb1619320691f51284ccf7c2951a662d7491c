<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I got a new laptop for work whith the with a 5800H (with some Vega graphics) and a 6600m dgpu,it is the HP Omen 16 from 2021. In short, it&#39;s this one</p> <p>This laptop has 1080@144hz (non-primary display) and is connected via HDMI to an external screen also 1080@144hz (primary display, right of laptop display). All of these using a X11 session.</p> <p>After tackling some issues with the driver config (external screen being unresponsive, system freezing etc) I face these two minor issues:</p> <ol> <li>1. System seems to never shut down the screens after the set inactivity time. Using the amdgpu driver, system stays in the lock screen forever. If using the modesetting driver, screens turn on again automatically seconds after being shut down.</li> <li>2. After unlocking, all windows are moved to the laptop display and its extremely annoying due to the number of apps that I have opened at any given time during work.</li> </ol> <p>I have spent a couple of days trying to find a solution, but no luck. Also, since I&#39;m not really an expert on these matters I&#39;m not really sure which info should I post here so:</p> <p><a href="https://pastebin.com/YYb6dfWt">Xorg.0.log</a></p> <p><a href="https://pastebin.com/dQVAQKAz">lspci -k</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-gpu.conf</p> <pre><code>Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier &quot;6600m&quot; Driver &quot;amdgpu&quot; BusID &quot;PCI:3:0:0&quot; Option &quot;TearFree&quot; &quot;true&quot; Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;3&quot; EndSection </code></pre> <p>cat /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-amdgpu.conf</p> <pre><code>Section &quot;OutputClass&quot; Identifier &quot;AMDgpu&quot; MatchDriver &quot;amdgpu&quot; Driver &quot;amdgpu&quot; EndSection </code></pre> <p>I can provide any other info that might be useful.</p> <p>Any assistance will be very appreciated :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/therealmistersister"> /u/therealmistersister </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vy5252/issues_with_amd_laptop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vy5252/issues_with_amd_laptop/">[comments]</a></span>
