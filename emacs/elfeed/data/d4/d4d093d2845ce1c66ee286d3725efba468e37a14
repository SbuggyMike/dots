<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://github.com/AchetaGames/Epic-Asset-Manager/releases/tag/v3.6.0">EAM 3.6.0</a> was just released with a new way of installing Unreal Engine on Linux.</p> <p>As some may have noticed Epic Games announced official Linux binaries this month. This option has now been added to the Epic Asset Manager.</p> <p>This is part of continuous effort to make life with Unreal Engine on Linux easier.</p> <p>The recommended way of getting Epic Asset Manager is through <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.achetagames.epic_asset_manager">flathub</a> so if you want to give it a go, try that route.</p> <p>P.S.: For those who do not know EAM lets you download Unreal marketplace assets you have previously purchased, add them to your projects, create new projects and most importantly Install the engine without the need of compilation, which not only saves time but also disk space.</p> <p>Some bugs and future breakage is expected, but the more people use the tool, the sooner it gets ironed out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aknarts"> /u/aknarts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wa286f/install_official_unreal_engine_binaries_with_epic/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wa286f/install_official_unreal_engine_binaries_with_epic/">[comments]</a></span>
