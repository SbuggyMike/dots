<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I installed Arch through Archinstall, with the apps discover, firefox, dolphin, and konsole. I chose the desktop profile, with proprietary Nvidia drivers and KDE as the DE. I also used GRUB instead of systemd&#39;s tool. However, when I get past GRUB, it hangs on a message about loading Linux into RAM. However, the disk activity light still blinks and my screen&#39;s connection LED turns green. How can I fix this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Comparison7153"> /u/No_Comparison7153 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131e0my/arch_hangs_on_boot_after_grub_starts_loading_arch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131e0my/arch_hangs_on_boot_after_grub_starts_loading_arch/">[comments]</a></span>
