<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I run Kubuntu 20.04 on my system and Dolphin is my default file manager. I&#39;ve noticed that the copying &amp; moving files/folders could be a lot more seamless if a few parameters could be set. I often copy or move large amounts of files from my Downloads directory to various other folders on the drive &amp; from there, I copy or move those files/folders to their backup locations on an external mounted drive.</p> <p>The problem is that I often find that there are a number of files that are duplicates and when I&#39;m moving 50-200+ GB of data (which can take a little while, especially to the external drive) I&#39;ll get lots of notices asking me if I want to Overwrite, Skip or Rename the file AND the process will tell me if the files look identical or which one is newer or larger. I&#39;d say that 95+% of the time I&#39;m told they are identical so I select &quot;skip&quot; (instead of spending all the time overwriting the other identical file).</p> <p>Now there is an option of &quot;Apply to all&quot; which would be GREAT, IF all the other duplicate files are identical &amp;/or all of the other files left in the queue were already at the copy location, but that is usually not the case and I won&#39;t know which files still NEED to be copied or which files are not identical until I get the notice from Dolphin. And each time this happens, the copying is paused, so if I&#39;m away from my computer, this transfer could take a long time.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>So I&#39;m wondering if there is a way to automatically select &quot;skip&quot; for all files that are deemed to be identical, automatically copy the files that are new to the destination location and possibly rename any of the files that are duplicates by name but are not deemed to be identical (I&#39;d be very happy if they might even put them in a separate folder for any non-identical file, &amp; give me the option to rename or keep original). And to top all this off, would it be possible to prioritize all non-duplicate file transfers first, then dupe file names of non-identical size &amp; finally identical filenames w/ identical sizes (would be great if something like a MD5SUM could automatically be run to ensure they are identical!).</p> <p>If the above isn&#39;t very easy to do, I&#39;d love for it to just keep copying non-duplicate files while it prompts me if I want to &quot;overwrite&quot; &quot;skip&quot; &quot;rename&quot; a file, so the transfer is completed when I return (except for those that require input) so the program doesn&#39;t stop after 1GB of transfer w/ 200+ GB remaining b/c it wanted to know what to do about an identical file.</p> <p>Oh, and clicking the &quot;apply to all&quot; just apply&#39;s that choice to every other file on the queue, so if you choose to skip an identical file, you just skipped every subsequent file/folder to be copied (pretty dumb IMO) &amp; it&#39;s the same for overwrite &amp; rename.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KDE_Fan"> /u/KDE_Fan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w490h5/automating_skip_overwrite_rename_when_they_fit/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w490h5/automating_skip_overwrite_rename_when_they_fit/">[comments]</a></span>
