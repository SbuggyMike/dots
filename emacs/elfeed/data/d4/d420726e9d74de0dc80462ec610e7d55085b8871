<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to make a new iso using archiso, which I&#39;ve done before without issue. I&#39;m on a newer install, but installed archiso via pacman and copied <code>/usr/share/archiso/configs/releng</code> to the <code>archlive</code> folder. Everything is there as it should be, I added my own <code>packages.x86_64</code>, added a few things to <code>archlive/airootfs/root/</code> and tried to make the iso using:</p> <p><code># mkarchiso -v -w /tmp/archiso-tmp ./profiledef.sh</code></p> <p>from the archlive folder. </p> <p>However, I&#39;m getting the error: <code>[mkarchiso] ERROR: Profile &#39;/home/user/Documents/isos/archlive/profiledef.sh&#39; does not exist!</code></p> <p>the file definitely exists; I used tab completion to type it. I can also edit it with vim and everything looks to be in order. I&#39;ve also tried using the absolute path but I get the same error. </p> <p>Any idea what&#39;s going wrong?</p> <p>EDIT: I found the answer, apparently mkarchiso wants the path to the folder containing <code>profiledef.sh</code>, not the actual path to the file. I feel like the wiki could be updated to make this a little more clear.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LorenWard"> /u/LorenWard </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wdpx4b/problem_making_an_iso_with_archiso/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wdpx4b/problem_making_an_iso_with_archiso/">[comments]</a></span>
