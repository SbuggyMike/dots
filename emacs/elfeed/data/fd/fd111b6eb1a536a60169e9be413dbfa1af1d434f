<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hey guys, noob here. i’ve had arch for about a week and it has been running great for me, had an uptime of 3 days with zero issues and felt like rebooting on a whim to get my glava to initialize correctly in the background. on rebooting, it fails to mount my external HDD (only used to store my steam games, no system files or partitions on this drive that i know of at all) and because of this, i get a dependency failed for local file system error. not quite sure what approach to take here since it’s just my external hard drive. i probably messed something up when i followed <a href="https://youtu.be/Acg_z8ajxDQ">this tutorial</a> to permanently mount that drive. what do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ggkazii"> /u/ggkazii </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5aum1/booting_into_emergency_mode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5aum1/booting_into_emergency_mode/">[comments]</a></span>
