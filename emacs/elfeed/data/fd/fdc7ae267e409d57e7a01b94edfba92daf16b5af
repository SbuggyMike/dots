<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Dear <a href="/r/emacs">r/emacs</a> community,</p> <p>We are researchers at <a href="http://www.inria.fr/en/">Inria</a> (<a href="https://loki.lille.inria.fr/">EP Loki</a>) studying how users automate frequent actions in their daily use of interactive software (e.g., <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyboardMacros">macros</a> in Emacs, <a href="https://github.com/InamuraJIN/ActionRecorder">actions</a> in Blender, or <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/creating-actions.html">actions</a> in the Adobe Suite). We recently created a questionnaire that takes 30 to 45 minutes to complete and are looking for participants (we tried to shorten it as much as we could). We unfortunately cannot offer compensation for that, but are hoping data from volunteers will help us design more customizable systems on the long term. Any help would be deeply appreciated.</p> <p>Questionnaire : <a href="https://expe.lille.inria.fr/limesurvey/index.php/526753?lang=en&amp;community=emacs">https://expe.lille.inria.fr/limesurvey/index.php/526753?lang=en&amp;community=emacs</a></p> <p>If this research is of any interest to you, we are also looking for participants to interview about their specific solutions to automate frequent actions. Please contact use if you are willing to share your experience, our emails are available in the first page of the questionnaire or you can simply DM me.</p> <p>Note: be aware our questionnaire relies on LimeSurvey which uses non-libre JS libraries.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/b_fruchard"> /u/b_fruchard </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13bjfvi/survey_on_using_and_designing_automated_actions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13bjfvi/survey_on_using_and_designing_automated_actions/">[comments]</a></span>
