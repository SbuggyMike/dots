In zoom everything works perfectly fine. This problem never occurred when i was using Ubuntu</p> <p>I share this in <a href="/r/endevouros">r/endevouros</a> - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EndeavourOS/comments/wgxmxi/application_screen_sharing_or_share_window_not/">https://www.reddit.com/r/EndeavourOS/comments/wgxmxi/application_screen_sharing_or_share_window_not/</a></p> <p>They linked me to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#WebRTC_screen_sharing">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#WebRTC_screen_sharing</a> I&#39;m having difficulty understanding it.
