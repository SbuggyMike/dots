<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am using emacs for the past 3 years and I have developed my ecosystem around emacs. I like to read a lot of articles and research papers and I have been setting up org roam for the same purpose. I have purchased an iPad recently to increase my productivity(watching lectures on youtube and reading some articles in my free time or while I am traveling). </p> <p>Do you guys have any suggestions on using org roam with iPad for notetaking? I could not find anything on the internet apart from an indirect integration via logseq. </p> <p>I am sure some of you would have faced similar issues. Any suggestion is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zallthetime"> /u/zallthetime </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wcm8a2/emacs_workflow_with_ipad/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wcm8a2/emacs_workflow_with_ipad/">[comments]</a></span>
