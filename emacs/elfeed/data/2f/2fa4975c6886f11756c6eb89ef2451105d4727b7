<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve gotten myself into a peculiar situation where I&#39;d appreciate to explicitly list certain packages to be searched in and installed or upgraded from a repository while excluding all the other packages listed in that same repository. Why such a strange requirement? I installed the precompiled binary version of the XanMod kernel (<a href="https://archlinux.pkgs.org/rolling/andontie-aur-x86_64/linux-xanmod-5.13.7-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.html">linux-xanmod</a>) as wall as its headers (<a href="https://archlinux.pkgs.org/rolling/andontie-aur-x86_64/linux-xanmod-headers-5.13.7-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.html">linux-xanmod-headers</a>) directly from the <a href="https://aur.andontie.net/">Andontie AUR</a> repository because I&#39;m a lazy bum that doesn&#39;t want to compile all of that locally and I&#39;m just fine with the default compile-time options. That all works as expected but there&#39;s a problem. I also have to have the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/displaylink/">displaylink</a> package installed (my USB dock&#39;s Ethernet port doesn&#39;t work without it) which depends on the evdi package (I use <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/evdi-git/">evdi-git</a> which provides support for newer kernels). This is an out-of-tree kernel module that needs to be built after every kernel (or its own) upgrade. Both of these packages are also available in the Andontie AUR repository but the evdi-git was outdated there (now it&#39;s apparently not but that&#39;s beside the point) for quite a while which made it incompatible with kernels (DKMS couldn&#39;t install it) present on my machine once the stable (and consequently XanMod) kernel reached version 5.13. I mean, I have the LTS kernel installed just for these kinds of situations even though that&#39;s really a last resort. What I had to do (or rather what I knew would most likely work) was comment out the Andontie AUR&#39;s section in the pacman.conf file and upgraded the evdi-git package straight from the AUR. That worked like a charm but it&#39;s damn annoying to have to do that each and every time something like this happens. So, what I&#39;d like is to be able is to use the Andontie AUR repository‚Äç solely for the linux-xanmod and linux-xanmod-headers package while ignoring everything else it has to offer. Can it be done?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The9thHuman"> /u/The9thHuman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg6sb0/any_way_to_explicitly_include_certain_packages/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg6sb0/any_way_to_explicitly_include_certain_packages/">[comments]</a></span>
