The US clinical trial data for some recently approved anti-cancer drugs
is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/29/cancer-researchers-unable-to-access-clinical-trial-data-for-top-selling-drugs-study-finds">still secret</a> some years later.

The US government should stop negotiating with those exploitative
companies and legislate that the US government can and will publish
those studies as soon as the drug is approved.  Or perhaps as soon as
the application for approval is filed.

The biggest companies tend to want to increase their trade secrecy to
gain more advantage over competitors.  But what is good for the public
is to give the biggest companies <em>less</em> advantage over competitors.
Therefore, whenever there is a public-interest reason to demand that
companies come clean about their operations, we should make that a
legal requirement.
