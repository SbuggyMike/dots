He Sold Home to CEO of Major Law Firm.*
That was just before Gorsuch got onto the Supreme Court.
  That law firm has had 22 cases before the Supreme Court
since then.

I don't know whether Gorsuch made any decisions specifically in return
for (or gratitude for) that sale of property.  It could be that
Gorsuch's <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#plutocratist">plutocratist</a> ideology is firm and he would usually have
decided for the benefit of the wealthy.  Perhaps that law firm
generally represents the wealthy.  If so, that law firm perhaps had
no need to pay to assure his support most of the time.  Maybe he was
glad to get paid off for harm he would have done anyway.
