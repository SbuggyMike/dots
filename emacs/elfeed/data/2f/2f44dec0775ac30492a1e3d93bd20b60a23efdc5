<p>&#8216;S48(1) of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 empowers the High Court to authorise personal representatives or trustees to take action on the basis of counselâ€™s opinion where any question of construction has arisen out of the terms of a will or trust. The opinion must be given by counsel with a minimum of 10-years High Court qualification. If so authorised, the personal representative or trustee will be protected from liability for mismanagement of the estate or breach of trust.&#8217;</p>
