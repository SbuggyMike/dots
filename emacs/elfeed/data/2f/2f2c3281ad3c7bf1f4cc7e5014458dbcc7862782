Yet more gratuitous

This article mentions a policy of making asylum seekers throw away
all their personal possessions, as well as specific cruelty towards
Sikh men &mdash; forcing them to violate religious commandments for no
rational reason.

Religion is not an excuse for someone to violate safety requirements
or mistreat anyone else.  But these particular Sikh religious
practices don't hurt or endanger anyone.

When "security forces" display a persistent habit of gratuitous
cruelty, we cannot take their word about what they do.  Their
punishment should be a requirement to document how they treat each
asylum seeker.
