<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lately i have been getting ideas about classical music style pieces in my heard, not complete orchestracions but a melody and some other instruments so i play those melodys in my violin, i have been thinking of actually writting down this ideas but i have found musescore and it makes the job easier, anyway, my question is that is it cheating to compose in computer?, By cheating i mean not being a &quot;real&quot; composer for a lack of creativity to do all the orchestration in My mind. Just to clarify, the ideas of melodies come from My mind and creativity, i use musescore to add harmony with other instruments to My pieces and hear if they sound good.</p> <p>PD: i love classical music and i play the violin, i know some music theory. I don&#39;t have a piano to compose.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aderezos"> /u/Aderezos </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/132gd0e/am_i_cheating_in_composition/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/132gd0e/am_i_cheating_in_composition/">[comments]</a></span>
