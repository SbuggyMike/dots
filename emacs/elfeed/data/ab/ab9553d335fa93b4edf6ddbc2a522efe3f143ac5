<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The idea behind both of these is to run commands one after another, but there is one subtle difference: <code>;</code> will run the second command immediately after the first one returns, but <code>&amp;&amp;</code> will only run the second one if and only if the first command returns 0 (success). Returning anything else or crashing will result in the second command not being run. Note that a line break (<code>\n</code>) is the same as using <code>;</code> in Bash.</p> <p>Here&#39;s an example: Let&#39;s say you are cloning a Git repository, then installing the software. So the goal is to run <code>git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo</code>, then run <code>cd myrepo</code>, and then <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code>. Simple enough. A naive script:</p> <pre><code>git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo cd myrepo make make install </code></pre> <p>...or the one-liner:</p> <pre><code>git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo; cd myrepo; make; make install </code></pre> <p>Both of these will usually work, but the second command onward is only valid if the <code>git clone</code> succeeds! Otherwise, <code>./myrepo</code> will not exist, so <code>cd</code> will fail, and then the Bash will end up running <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code> on the current directory.</p> <p>Note that there is a double-whammy in the naive script; <code>make install</code> is only valid if <code>make</code> works! So if compilation fails, and the makefile is either misconfigured or worse, you could end up installing junk.</p> <p>So if you&#39;re smart and you know your stuff about Bash, you would instead write:</p> <pre><code>git clone https://www.github.com/NateNate60/myrepo &amp;&amp; \ cd myrepo &amp;&amp; \ make &amp;&amp; make install </code></pre> <p>...or maybe you&#39;d store the return value and intelligently report an error to the user :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NateNate60"> /u/NateNate60 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wdx04a/ysk_you_usually_should_use_instead_of_in_bash/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wdx04a/ysk_you_usually_should_use_instead_of_in_bash/">[comments]</a></span>
