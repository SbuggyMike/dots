The American Data Privacy and Protection Act takes a step toward
limiting how companies can snoop on computer users.  But the bad part
is 
<a href="https://teachprivacy.com/a-faustian-bargain-is-preemption-too-high-a-price-for-a-federal-privacy-law/">that it preempts state laws.</a>
<p>
I suspect that the ADPPA is fundamentally based on limiting the use of
data once collected, an approach that it is inadequate, because the
only method that will really work is to 
<a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html"><Em>limit the collection of the
data</Em>.</a>
<p>
If states can't pass laws that go beyond this, all progress will
stop.

So I think this law should not be passed.
