<p>I rarely use any of the diff utilities these days and when I do it’s mostly Ediff to resolve merge conflicts. That probably means I’m working too hard but I’ve always been that way: I just never think of using diff unless I’m really in trouble.</p>
<p>Most other folks are more reasonable and use some sort of diff regularly. A common use case is checking the differences between two versions of a file stored in a Git repository. Magit, of course, has that built in—several options, in fact—but Kaushal Modi really likes the syntax highlighted diff he gets with the command line tool <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta">delta</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, Modi wants to stay in Emacs and use Magit. Fortunately, Dan Davison, the author of delta has a package, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/magit-delta">magit-delta</a>, that allows it to work with Magit. Installation is pretty easy. Just install delta from your favorite package manager (it’s called <code>git-delta</code> in most package managers) and then install magit-delta by adding it to your <code>init.el</code>.</p>
<p>There is, apparently, an issue with displaying line numbers with git-delta (an issue has been raised) but it’s easy to work around that. Take a look at <a href="https://scripter.co/using-git-delta-with-magit/?utm_source=atom_feed">Modi’s post</a> to see screen shots of both the normal delta and the magit-delta output. If you like what you see, just install delta and magit-delta and give them a try. It’s easy to turn it off if you decide you don’t like it.</p>
