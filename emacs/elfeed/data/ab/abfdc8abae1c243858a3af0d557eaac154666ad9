<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have ALSA, Pulseaudio, and I believe Jack came with Firefox. However there is no device selectable in Discord. Audacity doesn&#39;t recognise the mic either (only ALSA is selectable in there). This is my first time with a minimalistic distro like this, usually the needed things are preinstalled. Audio works, but mic doesn&#39;t.</p> <p>I looked up already around the internet and could not find much. Maybe it&#39;s due to not being able to precisely phrase the search terms due to not being a native speaker.</p> <p>Please tell me which software do I need to install to make it work. If you need any command outputs do ask!</p> <p>Edit: apparently at some point since I last checked Discord it has decided to recognise devices, but it does not receive any input still. Audacity is still the same.</p> <p>Edit 2: I installed pavucontrol which enabled the Volume Control option on pasystray and that allowed me to find that my mic had been muted all along! Simple but was not accessible unless I used some terminal tricks which I am not aware of.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/5ucur"> /u/5ucur </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wigq2m/which_audio_software_driver_is_needed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wigq2m/which_audio_software_driver_is_needed/">[comments]</a></span>
