<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;m in the progress of making my transition from Windows + WSL to running Arch as my primary OS and I need some help setting up. In Windows I had a workflow which involved opening up a specific file on my Google Drive, reading/editing that file and saving the file. Google Drive sync handled all the syncing between my local copy and Google Drive copy. </p> <p>My question is: How to set this up in Arch?</p> <p>I am aware that an official Google Drive client does not exist (although it has been promised by Google). I would rather not switch cloud provider as I am already paying Google for some extra storage. </p> <p>I am aware of Insync, but do not want to pay extra for a client. I would also prefer to have it open source. I have been looking at Rclone, but it seems that two-way sync is not possible (I would be glad to hear if I am wrong though). </p> <p>Preferably I want the sync to be handled automatically. But I am also fine with manually pushing/pulling. Conflicts should be rare and I am fine with manually handling those. </p> <p>Has anyone set this up or has any tips to setting this up? I am not sure where to start. </p> <p>Thanks for the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/notunique221"> /u/notunique221 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8f05k/sync_specific_file_with_google_drive/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8f05k/sync_specific_file_with_google_drive/">[comments]</a></span>
