<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’m playing in my first OTB USCF tournament this weekend. I’m obviously “unrated.” I’m playing in the lowest section (U1200), which has 40 players, about 25 of them also being unrated. I know you get a provisional rating, but what if I only play unrated players in the event (4 matches)?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BigBoomer7"> /u/BigBoomer7 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wgjp2y/uscf_rating_question_unrated/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wgjp2y/uscf_rating_question_unrated/">[comments]</a></span>
