<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a new user. I have been using Linux for maybe 3 months; I deleted my Windows partition less than 2 months ago.</p> <p>To be honest, I have found that Linux gaming is pretty much on a similar level to Windows.</p> <p>I am by no means a tech savvy person. I am probably below average, compared to the average person. I do know the internal components of my PC, though, and I can troubleshoot software bugs or solve some problems on my own. And that&#39;s really all you need to know for Linux gaming. Well, that, and the ability to Google &quot;stuff&quot;.</p> <p>Via Steam, all you need to do is to use Proton, and most games will work out of the box, no issues. Most of Valve&#39;s first party games even have a native Linux port.</p> <p>I have a pretty sizeable GOG library, it&#39;s my favourite store. They don&#39;t have a Linux client. But you can just download the offline installers, point Wine to them using the terminal, insta them, and then play them, and it works.</p> <p>I have some PS1 games that I&#39;ve ripped. Thankfully, this is also covered, as the Duckstation emulator has been ported to Linux. I can now play those games without having to swap discs, or risking them getting scratched, in much higher resolution, and using a keyboard.</p> <p>Indeed, same thing with disc-based PC games. I have installed Warcraft 2 from an .iso I had ripped, it plays more or less fine.</p> <p>Really, many people say gaming on Linux is a nightmare compared to Windows, but... it is not, really? Most games work the same, for the most part. Or, if, hypothetically, I am getting 4 FPS less (+ some small glitches) than on Windows, is that a significant enough difference to make me frustrated? I would say not really.</p> <p>Some games I have had problems running: Shogun 2 Total War (has a native Linux port, but for some reason it does not launch), Icewind Dale 2 (2002), Diablo (1997). However, the latter two games are so old that this is not going to be a problem for most people, since only nerds like me still play those older titles. I have so many games that I can wait till I get savvy enough to get those games running myself.</p> <p>Examples of games I play: Age of Empires 2, Baldur&#39;s Gate 1&amp;2, Planescape: Torment, the Witcher, CS:GO, TF2 (the real TF2 from 2007, not Titanfall 2...), Fallout 1&amp;2, etc. Most of those games work just fine.</p> <p>Why do you people act like gaming on Linux is a horror-show when it is not, really? What&#39;s going on? It&#39;s basically identical to Windows.</p> <p>Let&#39;s be honest with ourselves. Most of us have bought so many games that if 20% of them does not work on Linux, that&#39;s still hundreds of titles we can play. And it&#39;s probably less than 20%. And the situation is going to get better every day.</p> <p>Thoughts? How do you feel about this?</p> <p>Edit: one key thing. If you are having performance issues, make sure you are using the closed-source Nvidia drivers, NOT the open source version. That&#39;s the first thing you ought to check. A reboot won&#39;t hurt, either. Then make sure you are using the closed source drivers once more. I don&#39;t even know why the open source version is a thing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/C111tla"> /u/C111tla </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/waahuq/new_user_here_in_my_opinion_linux_gaming_is/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/waahuq/new_user_here_in_my_opinion_linux_gaming_is/">[comments]</a></span>
