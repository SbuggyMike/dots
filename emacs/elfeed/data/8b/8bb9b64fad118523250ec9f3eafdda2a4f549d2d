<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been having the worst case of microphone noise. My recorded audio would include a consistent high-pitched static sound that I find best described as &quot;whine&quot; (kinda like coil whine). I suspect it&#39;s got something to do with my particular motherboard but I have no idea. Plugging in different mics in different places did nothing to help the issue and I would hear it the same with no mic plugged in.</p> <p>The solution is to use a package called <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/noise-suppression-for-voice/">noise-suppression-for-voice</a>. It uses the same neural net technology as rnnoise which is used by OBS studio. My best results have been achieved by using this along with the echo cancel module. After installing the above package, you want to add the following lines to your default.pa config file (mine is in .config/pulse/default.pa):</p> <pre><code># Create echo cancel source # module-echo-cancel will automatically cancel from the current default source load-module module-echo-cancel source_name=echo_cancel_source # Create denoised mic device load-module module-null-sink sink_name=denoised_mic_sink rate=48000 sink_properties=&#39;device.description=&quot;Denoised Mic&quot;&#39; load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=mic_sink sink_master=denoised_mic_sink label=noise_suppressor_stereo plugin=/usr/lib/ladspa/librnnoise_ladspa.so control=50 sink_properties=&#39;device.description=&quot;Noise Suppressor&quot;&#39; load-module module-loopback source=echo_cancel_source sink=mic_sink channels=2 source_dont_move=true sink_dont_move=true latency_msec=1 # Set as default source set-default-source denoised_mic_sink.monitor </code></pre> <p>Edit: of course, if anyone has any suggestions on how I can improve this, I&#39;m open. For example, I would really like to be able to remove the echo cancel module. It&#39;s clunky and doesn&#39;t seem like this is even the intended purpose for it, but for now, it is needed to completely eliminate the noise.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sk8r_dude"> /u/sk8r_dude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0n0e7/ultimate_noise_suppression_solution_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0n0e7/ultimate_noise_suppression_solution_for/">[comments]</a></span>
