<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p> <p>I&#39;ve been programming in C# on Windows for quite a few years but I&#39;ve recently decided to switch to Linux, mainly out of privacy concerns.</p> <p>So far I like it, but I would really like to contribute something to the community and I happen to have a bit of free time at the moment.</p> <p>So I figured it would be the perfect opportunity to start a new open source project, but to be honest, I don&#39;t really know what would be useful to the community. I would prefer to start a new project instead of contributing to an existing one, mainly because I enjoy designing apps from scratch.</p> <p>The only requirement I have is that it will be in C#, I know this used to be a Windows-only language but it&#39;s the language I know best and the SDK is now 100% open source, so that should not be a problem.</p> <p>Other than that I&#39;m open to all kinds of suggestions, CLI tool, GUI app, anything really. As long as there is enough interest in it and I have the required expertise, I&#39;ll be glad to work on it.</p> <p>I really want to work on something that will be useful to the Linux/Open source communities and hopefully you guys will help me do that.</p> <p>(I&#39;ll decide which project to work on based on the number of upvotes and how much I like the idea. So if you see an idea that you like don&#39;t forget to upvote it!)</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Delicious-Pudding-56"> /u/Delicious-Pudding-56 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wgbvz4/any_idea_for_an_open_source_linux_app/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wgbvz4/any_idea_for_an_open_source_linux_app/">[comments]</a></span>
