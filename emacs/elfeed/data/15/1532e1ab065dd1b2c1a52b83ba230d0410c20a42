<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Would like to request insight on issues with VirtualBox Guests failing to boot after a <code>sudo pacman -Syu</code></p> <p>This post is for general insight into problems for VirtualBox. I&#39;d ask others to avoid complaining, and hope those who experience the same or similar could offer some details.</p> <p>The last, approximately 4 times, I&#39;ve upgraded Virtualbox the guests fail to boot. I&#39;ve not identified a cause at this point. The resolution I&#39;ve been using is to uninstall Virtualbox and the <code>virtualbox-host-modules-arch</code> And re-install. This seems to be less than elegant way to address the issue.</p> <p>I&#39;ve checked around the Wiki page at <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VirtualBox">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VirtualBox</a> and haven&#39;t found anything that stands out to address the issues and avoid re-installing at each upgrade.</p> <p>The last few times however, I also noticed some Virtualbox files that repaired virtualbox, which was helpful.</p> <p>I plan to dig into the issue for my system tomorrow, because I&#39;ll have some time to address with a clear head. (Getting over Covid)</p> <p>Has anyone else had issues with booting their VB Guests after upgrading? Even is anecdotal; or if you could share you own experiences would be helpful. I realize that we may not have the same issues, however, I think additional insight could be helpful when I start troubleshooting properly.</p> <p>Thank You in Advance.</p> <p>EDIT/UPDATE: </p> <p>Was messing with this before I got to bed and Learned something </p> <p>I have a relatively recent, AMD 4800hs cpu. Had to add <code>spectre_v2=off</code> to the Kernel Command line in the guests in order to boot successfully.</p> <p>Per Kernel Lore, this is fixed upstream.</p> <p>Reference was on the Arch Forums here <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=2049636#p2049636">https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=2049636#p2049636</a></p> <p>Thanks all.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomXUsr"> /u/RandomXUsr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whgxc2/virtual_box_unable_to_launch_guest_oses_after/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whgxc2/virtual_box_unable_to_launch_guest_oses_after/">[comments]</a></span>
