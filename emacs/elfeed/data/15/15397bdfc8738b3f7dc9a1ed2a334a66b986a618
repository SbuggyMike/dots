Some
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/mccarthy-debt-ceiling-plan-10-million-medicaid">20 million Americans would be at risk</a>
of losing Medicaid funding
for their medical care, if House Speaker McCarthy gets his way.
<p>
 Precisely how many millions would actually lose coverage we cannot
tell, since it would depend on many decisions yet to be made.
<p>
If it comes out to around 10 million, my rough guess is that a few
percent of them would die as a result within a few years.  That will
be hundreds of thousands killed.
<p>
Shall we call him Massacre McCarthy?
