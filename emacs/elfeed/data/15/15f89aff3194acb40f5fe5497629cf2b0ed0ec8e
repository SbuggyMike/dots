The <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#epa">EPA's</a> new pollution rules for fossil fuel power plants
are <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/epa-rules-carbon-capture-wont-work">predicated on the assumption that carbon capture will work
    and will be used</a>.
<p>
So far, it doesn't work, and the only reason anyone assumes it will work
is due to fossil fuel lobbying.
