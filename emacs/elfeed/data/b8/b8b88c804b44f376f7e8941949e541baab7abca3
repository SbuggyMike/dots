<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to understand how org-colview.el works so I&#39;ve started writing some tests &amp; refactoring it <a href="https://github.com/slk500/org-colview.el">https://github.com/slk500/org-colview.el</a>. There is a lot of &#39;ifs&#39; with &#39;agenda view&#39; which adds a lot of complexity to code. I&#39;m curious how other people use this feature. I have not found any screenshots or video with it.<br/> Could you post some screenshots? And write for what you are using it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/slk_g500"> /u/slk_g500 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13926nx/column_view_in_the_agenda_please_show_some/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13926nx/column_view_in_the_agenda_please_show_some/">[comments]</a></span>
