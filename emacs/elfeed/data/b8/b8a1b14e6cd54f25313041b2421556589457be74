<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Any one have a setup with <a href="https://github.com/fasheng/elfeed-protocol">Elfeed-protocol</a> that can tell me if it is possible to do two way sync of feeds? I have managed to get a setup up working with synchronization between elfeed and miniflux with the fever API. As it works now, I can read the feeds I add in miniflux in emacs with elfeed, and the read state and everything is correctly synced. However the feeds I set up in emacs aren&#39;t synced to miniflux, and I don&#39;t know if it is supposed to be like this or if there is something wrong with my setup.</p> <p>I would prefer to be able to set up every feed from emacs and have it synced to the miniflux db, but maybe that is not possible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GangstaKirBie"> /u/GangstaKirBie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w6ucd2/elfeedprotocol_two_way_sync/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w6ucd2/elfeedprotocol_two_way_sync/">[comments]</a></span>
