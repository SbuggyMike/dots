<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey people! I’ve played chess on lichess for about 16 months now, and I’ve reached 1700 Rapid rating. I was in the 1500 bracket for a long time but recently got into 1700s (Puzzles around 2000).</p> <p>At first I thought it was a strange coincidence but now I really feel that it’s somehow easier to maintain my rating at 1700 without drops due to the fact that players in this category seem to blunder more often, or play more carelessly than lower rated players. Especially they seem to play very quickly on their clock. Has anyone had a similar experience or any ideas? This thread might lack a bit of substance excuse me</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Strict-Coyote-9807"> /u/Strict-Coyote-9807 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w976fv/1700_easier_than_1500/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w976fv/1700_easier_than_1500/">[comments]</a></span>
