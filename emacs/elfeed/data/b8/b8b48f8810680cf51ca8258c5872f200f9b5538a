<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! </p> <p>I&#39;m in the middle of a class project at the moment where I have to pick a classical piece that encapsulates a character&#39;s emotional state over a certain period of time. I&#39;m pretty unfamiliar with classical music, so I figured I&#39;d turn here and see what ideas people might have. I&#39;m looking for a piece that&#39;s about three minutes, or has a three minute section that begins calmly but perhaps has a sense of looming, and gradually becomes tense and perhaps frenetic - it can either stay tense/frenetic or become calm again. It doesn&#39;t have to be historical, just classical/orchestral. I really appreciate it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fantasticthespianman"> /u/fantasticthespianman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wjhi9n/song_recommendation_for_a_class_project/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wjhi9n/song_recommendation_for_a_class_project/">[comments]</a></span>
