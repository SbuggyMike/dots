<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I recently tried out a prime technology and I really like it, but I have one problem, it&#39;s tearing, in DWM and in i3 when I don&#39;t use picom I don&#39;t get a tearing but when I use picom I get a tearing only in applications which I use with nvidia card, also I always get a tearing on second monitor and it doesn&#39;t matter picom works or it doesn&#39;t work. So how can I fix this? May be do I need a good picom configuration? Or do I need something else? I enabled all kms for nvidia, I wrote a line in grub about nvidia-drm, I tried to use Linux with nvidia driver and linux-lts with nvidia-lts but anyway I get a tearing, my nvidia GPU is GeForce MX150 my Intel GPU is UHD Graphics 620. If you need any logs, please ask me, because I don&#39;t know which logs do I need to share in this situation. I have tearing in prime-run in games and in blender but I share a video with a blender here: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/L2mlzKg">https://imgur.com/a/L2mlzKg</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Particular_Bug388"> /u/Particular_Bug388 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2pkpt/tearing_with_primerun/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2pkpt/tearing_with_primerun/">[comments]</a></span>
