<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was curious who the owners of RR were and saw that Shane Warne was listed as one of the owners. After a little digging, found out that he got a 3% stake as an incentive for him to come out of retirement. If you consider the Forbes 2022 valuation of $1 billion for RR, his stake alone is worth 30 million or 245 crore rupees. That is more money than any other player has earned from the auctions. If you ignore brand deals, does Warne have the highest earnings via the IPL amongst players? </p> <p>I searched a bit more but couldn&#39;t find any other player who owned equity in a franchise. I assumed in the early days of IPL, some of the other big names might have also got some equity. Is there any other such player?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lol1009"> /u/lol1009 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/138v2y7/is_shane_warne_the_only_player_who_ownsowned_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/138v2y7/is_shane_warne_the_only_player_who_ownsowned_a/">[comments]</a></span>
