<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title says. I recently installed emacs 28.1 with native comp on Arch in wslg, and noticed that everything, even small files, were slowing to a crawl when scrolling. A profile showed that linum-mode was to blame. I disabled it and voil√°, yeah, everything was smooth. That got me puzzled, since I expected that having linum-mode native would make it faster, not slower (though I understand things are not that simple, specially in a VM).</p> <p>Now I had to switch to display-line-numbers-mode, which works perfectly, but, as many others, I really don&#39;t like the positioning.</p> <p>Any ideas? Either of speeding up linum-mode or changing position of display-line-numbers-mode,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gothlenin"> /u/gothlenin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf6vso/linummode_in_emacs_native_comp_super_slow/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf6vso/linummode_in_emacs_native_comp_super_slow/">[comments]</a></span>
