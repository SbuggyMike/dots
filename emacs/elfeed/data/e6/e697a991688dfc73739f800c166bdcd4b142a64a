<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For some reason, a few months ago the line spacing in Org Mode has increased. It&#39;s the line spacing between display lines, not merely between paragraphs or headings. The line spacing in my org-mode files has increased to 1.5 or 2 (just guessing).</p> <p>The variable &quot;line-spacing&quot; is nil. Actually setting it doesn&#39;t help.</p> <p>If I open a non-org-mode text file in emacs, the line spacing is fine.</p> <p>I discovered that the issue comes from org-indent-mode. But I also don&#39;t know why org-indent-mode would cause this. Does anyone have any ideas of what setting I can change?</p> <p>UPDATE: I was able to fix this by following the solution at the link provided below by JDRiverRun.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/micahacobb"> /u/micahacobb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w5oo0d/emacs_org_mode_how_to_reduce_line_spacing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w5oo0d/emacs_org_mode_how_to_reduce_line_spacing/">[comments]</a></span>
