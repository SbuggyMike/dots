<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, i&#39;m new to Arch and currently experimenting inside VMware.</p> <p>I&#39;m getting a new laptop for work soon and i was thinking of installing Arch with KDE Plasma. So now i&#39;m checking if i can install most of the things i need for work, however i can&#39;t seem to find anything about Teleport on Arch? <a href="https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/">Teleport installation guide</a></p> <p>Am i just missing something here or does it not exist for Arch?</p> <p>Is there someone here using Teleport with Arch that could be able to help me with how to install it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AuroraChrono"> /u/AuroraChrono </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4azxg/teleport_on_arch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4azxg/teleport_on_arch/">[comments]</a></span>
