<p>Another skirmish in the Vi(m) vs. Emacs wars. What do you do when you discover that your girlfriend uses Vim kitchen soap? If you’re an Emacser, the answer is clear: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12ou22q/told_her_i_have_to_throw_away_her_soap/">you tell her you have to throw it away</a>.</p>
<p>That’s an old joke by now but some of the comments are funny. The first and best is “Good luck figuring out how to quit it.” thereby combining two memes. Someone else suggested keeping it around for quick and dirty jobs.</p>
<p>All of this is fun as long as you remember that it’s just a silly diversion and shouldn’t under any circumstances be taken seriously. Of course, there are some who <i>will</i> take it seriously and they, paradoxically, will have the most fun with it.</p>
