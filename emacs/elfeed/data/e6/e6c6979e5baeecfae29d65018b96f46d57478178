<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>so reinstalled arch today and went from kde with a windows 7 theme to just a stock xfce theme while i figure out some major issues. the first of these is that firefox after the first boot of the system after install has become ungodly slow, taking upwards of minutes to start to display a webpage, even now ive been waiting around 10 minutes for a single webpage to start to load. when they do finally load start to load though its as if there was just a long lag spike that has been elevated and it loads as quick as it used to before the install. (connected via ethernet directly to the router on my main pc, my 2ndary pc also had this issue while i was building it. and that was over wifi to my friends wifi. i fixed it by switching to my phones hotspot so im not too sure whats going on) </p> <p>the second issue is that light dm fails to load on boot, but when running the service via command line it runs perfectly fine. the kicker to this is that i just did an install with the same usb drive on a different pc, with the same packages. and lightdm runs perfectly fine on boot on it. and i hadnt had this issue until today. </p> <p>if anyone could help it would be much appreciated as at this point im starting to lose my sanity with both of these issues suddenly cropping up. (22.7. 1 iso)</p> <p>Adendum- switching back to arch with kde as i cant be arsed to deal with the pure level of the main internet issue</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Redd_the_neko"> /u/Redd_the_neko </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wiw7h9/2_random_issues_firefox_slow_to_load_websites/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wiw7h9/2_random_issues_firefox_slow_to_load_websites/">[comments]</a></span>
