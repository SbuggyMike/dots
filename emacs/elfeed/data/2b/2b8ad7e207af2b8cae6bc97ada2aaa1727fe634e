Hindus in Manipur
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/indian-villages-burned-ethnic-violence">burned 1700 homes</a>
of people in the mostly-Christian
Kuki tribe.
  The victims have lost everything and believe they can never return
to their old lands or recover their stolen animals.

I have to suspect that Modi's ruling Hindu naionalist party had a hand
in this, but I don't actually know.
