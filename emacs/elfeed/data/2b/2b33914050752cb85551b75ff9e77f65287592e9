<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I thought this would be a good place to talk about companies that support or abandon Linux. Synology has their own VPN on their router called VPN Plus. To log in from a web browser, you have to have THEIR VPN client running on your laptop or remote computer trying to connect.</p> <p>Much to my surprise after buying their RT6600ax and three of their mesh routers to extend my network, I found I couldn&#39;t log into my VPN with my Linux laptop from outside the office. </p> <p>Why? Because while they still show that clients as being available for Windows, Apple, iOS, Android and Linux, they quietly stopped supporting the Linux one several years ago. Here&#39;s their download page. The last update that supported the Linux client was way back in version <a href="https://archive.synology.com/download/Utility/VPNPlusClient/1.3.9-0472">1.3.9-0472</a>. <a href="https://archive.synology.com/download/Utility/VPNPlusClient">https://archive.synology.com/download/Utility/VPNPlusClient</a></p> <p>When I download and installed the .deb file the link in the login process directs me to, it installs but it won&#39;t run. It&#39;s VERY old version, for Ubuntu 14.04. It gives the error <strong>./vpnclient: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</strong> when run in a terminal. These libraries have long since been deprecated. </p> <p>So when I take my linux laptop on the road and try to log into the Synology SSL VPN, I can&#39;t. I opened a ticket. They basically said that they stopped supporting the Linux client but maybe one day they would look at it.</p> <p>So when you think about companies that consider Linux a viable community to support, look elsewhere.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Catalina28TO"> /u/Catalina28TO </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13j9kci/synology_is_not_a_friend_of_the_linux_community/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13j9kci/synology_is_not_a_friend_of_the_linux_community/">[comments]</a></span>
