I use Emacs to pay my bills. Literally. I mean, I use it in my day job, obviously, but it’s not what I’m talking about today. In Poland, the most often used way to pay bills like electicity, phone, internet etc. is via bank transfers. To make a transfer you need to type at least the account number of the person or company you transfer money to, the description of the transaction and (obviously) the amount you need to pay. To simplify things, I defined a few recurring recipients in my bank system so that I only need to choose the recipient and type in the invoice number (as the description) and the amount. Still, this is a bit cumbersome. And this is where Emacs can come in.
