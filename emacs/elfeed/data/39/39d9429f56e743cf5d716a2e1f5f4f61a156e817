<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What I notice with Linux. I get somehow better audio like its more clear and better sound I don&#39;t know how but I&#39;m 100% sure I get better sound. Some native Windows games I swear work even better on Linux and it&#39;s more stable for me.<br/> There is also one weird thing that I can&#39;t explain but my eyes hurt less about 70%.<br/> For some reason on Windows my eyes are burning even if I use the same apps and everything but still the issue is there.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tinkerbaj"> /u/tinkerbaj </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13jnhhr/weird_linux_benefits_anyone_with_a_similar/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13jnhhr/weird_linux_benefits_anyone_with_a_similar/">[comments]</a></span>
