The UK will test a system that uses photos of drivers of passing cars
to detect those who are not wearing seat belts, or are

their hands.</a>

Detecting the use of a snoop-phone while driving is a good thing, in
itself, because that practice is dangerous.  But I wonder what else
these photos could (and will) be used for.  Will the state use them to
identify every driver by facial recognition?  And ever passenger, too?

There should be technical safeguards in the 
<a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">system to ensure it can't
be used for this</a>
