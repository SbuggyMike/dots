<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know that officially in the literature, Alan Walker mentioned of rumors about a Liszt cylinder recording with unfortunately nothing ever turning up as of now. I have also heard (anecdotally only) that Liszt was once approached to record something but refused because of the terrible quality of sound. Have you also heard of this story?</p> <p>I wanted to ask what you guys have heard regarding a possible Liszt recording? Do you think a recording exists or once existed of Liszt playing? Of all the cylinder recordings I havenâ€™t been able to find one that dates prior to 1888.</p> <p>Very interested in this and would love to hear your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pianistr2002"> /u/pianistr2002 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wd6r4m/what_of_the_legendmyths_of_a_liszt_cylinder/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wd6r4m/what_of_the_legendmyths_of_a_liszt_cylinder/">[comments]</a></span>
