Protests against Macron's arbitrary increase of the retirement age in
France are continuing after months, and <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> have taken up
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/05/02/france-protests-police-arrests/">arresting
people for the traditional protest</a>
of banging on pots.

I'm sure it is true that the finances of retirement pensions in France
have a problem that requires more funds.  But why turn first to the poor
to get them?  Macron did that because he is a "centrist", which means
"bowing to the rich and pretending that's what most people want."
<p>
The propaganda terms "centrist" and "moderate" can be compared with
"bolshevik", which was used by a minority to pretend to be the majority.
