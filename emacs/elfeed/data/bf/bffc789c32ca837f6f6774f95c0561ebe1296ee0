<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Nikolai Medtner (1879-1951) deserves a lot more love than he gets. He rivals Godowski for layered textures and his melodies are entrancing. I feel like his piano concertos should be standard parts of the repetoire, and anyone who isn&#39;t a classical music buff likely has never heard of the guy. </p> <p>Any Medtner love here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SadBumblebee9"> /u/SadBumblebee9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w7w8qy/medtner_appreciation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w7w8qy/medtner_appreciation/">[comments]</a></span>
