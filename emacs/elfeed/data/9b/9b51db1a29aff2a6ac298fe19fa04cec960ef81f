  After public criticism, <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/the-good-guys-to-pause-recording-customers-faceprints-following-backlash/113c5e59-42ff-4925-ae3b-755850f2f143">a national store chain in Australia agreed to
  stop using facial recognition on customers</a>.
<p>
  Sad that the organization that criticized this undermined itself by
  suggesting that maybe this tracking would not be so bad if the company
  had better informed customers about it.
<p>
  If the customers were well informed about the practice, the company
  could argue that they had implicitly consented to being tracked.  That
  means nothing &mdash; it is <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">no excuse for establishing universal tracking</a>!
  Even explicit consent from millions of people would be no excuse.
  Systematic tracking of people is the soil in which repression grows,
  and that is an injustice to everyone.
