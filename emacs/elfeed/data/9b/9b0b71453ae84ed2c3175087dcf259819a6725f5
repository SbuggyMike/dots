<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi dear community.</p> <p>I&#39;ll be putting forward an unpopular opinion in this post. I expect a lot of disagreement and criticism, but this is strongly required to have a good understanding about the GNU/Linux ecosystem. But in the end, I&#39;m not superimposing my opinion on anyone. It&#39;s just the way I think and would like to know your opinions (for or against) as well.</p> <p>Before getting to the argument, I would like to mention the fact that according to KDE neon&#39;s FAQ page (<a href="https://neon.kde.org/faq">here</a>), it is not a Distribution.</p> <blockquote> <p>Is it a distro? </p> <p>Not quite, it&#39;s a package archive with the latest KDE software on top of a stable base. While we have installable images, unlike full Linux distributions we&#39;re only interested in KDE software.</p> </blockquote> <p>I&#39;ll be using this very example to support my opinion in this post.</p> <p>To explain on the same a bit, the team behind KDE Neon only develops and takes care of a PPA repository. They compile the latest KDE packages for Ubuntu LTS and place them in this repo. It is just like any other third-party repo or PPA (Firefox, Chrome, etc.). The only difference is that, with KDE neon, you get an installer ISO that installs Ubuntu LTS, configures KDE Neon&#39;s PPA repo(s) and applies some personalization. Think of it as an alternative way of installing Ubuntu LTS, but along with a third-party repo pre configured and stuff from it being preinstalled. This is the reason why the team behind KDE Neon do not want to call it a distribution officially. Because it is not. </p> <p>But, it is also interesting to note that if KDE Neon is not a distribution, it ain&#39;t purely Ubuntu LTS as well. Why? Because the package archive from KDE Neon replaces packages that already exist in Ubuntu&#39;s official repositories. If we only consider &#39;main&#39; component of Ubuntu&#39;s repos, there are precisely 153 packages that will be not installed from Ubuntu&#39;s repo and instead KDE Neon&#39;s PPA. This makes the resultant installation something like</p> <p>Ubuntu LTS - ABC packages (from Ubuntu LTS) + ABC packages (from KDE Neon PPA) + XYZ packages (from KDE Neon PPA)</p> <p>[ABC exists in both and hence gets replaced; XYZ only exists in KDE Neon and hence is just additional packages]</p> <p>Now,</p> <ul> <li><strong>A =</strong> Take an Apple. Cut a slice out of it and throw this slice away, put a slice of orange in place. What will you call it now? An Apple? An Orange? This is where projects like Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Manjaro, MX Linux, Pop!_OS, antiX, KDE Neon, Devuan etc. fall. These projects take a proper Linux distribution and cut pieces out and replace them with their own. The final fruit is neither what it was nor a completely new fruit. It&#39;s a partial mix of two fruits.</li> <li><strong>B =</strong> Take another Apple. Do not cut anything out. Just apply Nutella spread over it. What will you call it now? This is where projects like EndeavourOS, Garuda, Linux Lite, etc. fall. These projects provide additional packages on top of a pre existing proper Linux distribution. The final fruit remains as it is, but is served with additional stuff.</li> <li><strong>C =</strong> Take an Apple seed. Change the genetics of the seed and grow it into a new kind of a Fruit. Call it whatever you want. This is where projects like Ubuntu, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux, etc. fall. These projects are complete Linux distributions in themselves, just that they choose to compile everything from source instead of making cuts into the final product. The final fruit is a complete fruit in itself inspired or totally cloned out of a pre existing fruit.</li> </ul> <p>In my opinion, we should only consider independent projects and projects being covered in the case <strong>C</strong> as Distributions. The projects that fall into <strong>B</strong> should be seen as an alternate install of the upstream distribution with additional packages. </p> <p>Projects falling under case <strong>A</strong> really freaks me out. Using a proper distro like Ubuntu LTS where some other project is replacing a lot of the packages takes away a lot of my confidence into the end installation. Not that I do not trust these projects, but theoretically, the installation would be a mixture of two different projects and none of these two projects have a control or influence on each other. Due to this fact, such projects (Linux Mint for an instance) use a lot of workarounds and hackery (Pinning packages and repositories, hijacking packages, etc.) to deal with the original project&#39;s (Ubuntu LTS) changes.</p> <p>A very basic argument I have in support of my criticism against Linux Mint is that although it ships with &#39;universe&#39;, &#39;multiverse&#39; components of Ubuntu LTS repositories enabled, it <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/download_all.php">mentions</a> Linux Mint 21 (based on Ubuntu 22.04), to be supported until 2027 (5 years) which is not true as the &#39;universe&#39; and &#39;multiverse&#39; components are only supported for 3 years (making it supported till 2025). Also, &#39;main&#39; and &#39;restricted&#39; components account for only ~8000 packages which are covered under the 5 year LTS commitment from Canonical. There are over 60,000 packages in total including multiverse and universe otherwise. This kind of miscommunication and misconceptions prevails in such projects. That is the reason I personally do not consider them to be &#39;Distributions&#39; and avoid using and recommending any of them to anyone including beginners.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> If KDE Neon calls itself a package archive and not a distribution, there&#39;s a reason for it and going by the same reason, Linux Mint, Zorin, Pop!_OS, etc. are package archives with installer ISO(s) too and not complete Linux Distributions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/itsmypc"> /u/itsmypc </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wi9o4d/opinion_lets_be_clear_about_what_a_distribution_is/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wi9o4d/opinion_lets_be_clear_about_what_a_distribution_is/">[comments]</a></span>
