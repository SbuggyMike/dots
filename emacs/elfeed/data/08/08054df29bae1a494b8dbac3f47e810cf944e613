<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What are the Misconceptions you had in Cricket regarding the rules, sport, players, teams etc</p> <p>Some Misconceptions I had were :</p> <p>For the longest time, I thought after every over it&#39;s the Batsmen who changed their sides and not the bowlers. I thought the Bowling &quot;ends&quot; Were just the place where they keep their foot while delivering. Also I never understood how fast bowlers create rough patches for spinners because of this. Also while playing informal Cricket in grounds, it was us as Batsmen who changed sides. </p> <p>I used to think Cricket is the most important international sport, Football was just a sport played by clubs and mostly only important in Latin America(brazil, argentina) and slightly in Europe. Well I&#39;d still say anyway that Cricket is the most important international sport and I&#39;m also a fan of Club football. </p> <p>Always thought that West Indies is a real country. Also thought that Cricket is the most popular sport in England etc. In gk books it was always written that England&#39;s national sport is Cricket also from here the Lords ground etc makes it seem like English people consider Cricket as their Holy grail (it should be) idk the &quot;national sport&quot; Thing is a misconception either, since Hockey isn&#39;t India&#39;s national sport. </p> <p>Always pronounced Ponting as Pointing and for some reason as a kid, imagined him like the Final Boss/Villain of Cricket. During 2011 World cup, my mother just used to talk about him that way as some dangerous captain and batsman (technically he was) . </p> <p>Thought One day Cricket is the ultimate form of Cricket and Test Cricket is just something that exists. One day was my favorite format back then, even though now I like test Cricket more.</p> <p>Edit : When I mean the most important international sport, I mean I also thought it had a lot of political relevance. Because of my small World view and being first exposed to Cricket during 2011 World Cup, I used to think Cricket matches are too important politically. Since all ministers, celebrities etc were attending the games.</p> <p>Edit 2 : I used to think Leg Spinners used their legs for whatever type of ball they&#39;re delivering. Didn&#39;t help that one of the first leg spinners I saw was some english guy with a weird action. I also didn&#39;t know what a off spinner meant, just though that &quot;off&quot; Is some special way they bowl. During those days, Leg spinners were rare to see so I thought they had some special technique difficult to master. Later I became a leg spinner myself. Calling a left arm leg spinner a chinaman bowler also created a lot of confusion and I thought again its something in their action that makes them call &quot;Chinaman&quot;.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/devasiaachayan"> /u/devasiaachayan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w3l6sl/misconceptions_you_had_in_cricket/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w3l6sl/misconceptions_you_had_in_cricket/">[comments]</a></span>
