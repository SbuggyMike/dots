<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>Before anything, i&#39;d like to let you know that I&#39;m pretty new to emacs (and loving it). </p> <p>So what I&#39;m trying to achieve is what title says, develop on a remote machine, I&#39;m using TRAMP to connect to remote machine, but then I&#39;ve no &quot;IDE&quot; features like, auto-completion, debugging, executing the code. </p> <p>I&#39;ve also tried to setup the lsp mode, without success. </p> <p>I&#39;m really sorry for this noob alike post, but there&#39;s not much more info I can provide, i&#39;m kinda lost atm. Is there any chance that you can give me some guidance that I can follow to make it to work? </p> <p>Thanks alot for your time</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ejingles"> /u/ejingles </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jhha9/remote_development_python_ide/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jhha9/remote_development_python_ide/">[comments]</a></span>
