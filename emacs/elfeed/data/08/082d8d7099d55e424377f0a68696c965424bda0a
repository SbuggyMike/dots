<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Morgan&#39;s England were known to go hard from ball 1 and this resulted in the occasional collapse when batting first due to unfamiliarity with the conditions and the need to reset an over ambitious target. Stats poiny that Morgan&#39;s England were better batting second than batting first. India and other teams are also following that pattern with conservatism thrown to the wind. I feel this necessitates a new kind of player at the top who is both expendable as well as can go hard at the top. Not someone like KL or Rohit when he might be a valuable batsman to have when the conditions become a bit more known. Probably someone like Sunil Narine but better against pace. I feel Ashwin if he&#39;s in the XI fits that role atleast for India in T20s</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cool_Abbreviations_9"> /u/Cool_Abbreviations_9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/whfpzf/an_expendable_player_for_going_hard_from_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/whfpzf/an_expendable_player_for_going_hard_from_the/">[comments]</a></span>
