I've seen report of a rumor that these missiles are inaccurate, so
maybe the missile was fired at the repair factory and hit the mall by
mistake, If that is true, it means another Putinite claim (that it was
accurate) is false.  And it is a war crime to bombard civilian areas
with inaccurate weapons.
