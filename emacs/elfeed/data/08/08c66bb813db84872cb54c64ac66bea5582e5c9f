<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>NEW DELHI :Knight Rider Sports, owned by Bollywood actors Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla, and Jay Mehta, is set to expand its presence in the world of sports, especially cricket. In May, it acquired the Abu Dhabi franchise in the UAE’s T20 cricket league. It was the company’s fourth acquisition after the Indian Premier League’s Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) franchise, Trinbago Knight Riders (TKR) of the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), and a team in the Major League Cricket (MLC) of the US. </p> <p>In an interview, Venky Mysore, chief executive officer of KKR and Red Chillies Entertainment, spoke about the popularity of cricket in the US and its plans to buy either another cricket team or a franchise in some other sport. </p> <p>What is the idea behind acquiring teams in so many sporting leagues?</p> <p>Our vision was always to acquire assets similar to KKR around the world that we could own and operationalize. The assets should be timed in a way where we could create a caravan model so that we start at one place and go on to the other.</p> <p>Has that played out well?</p> <p>Yes, about eight seasons ago, we went to the Caribbeans for CPL and acquired the Trinidad franchise TKR. It happened during August-September. We’d already taken this step before anybody else even thought of it. The IPL was a two-month product and we had to figure out how to take the high-decibel event and keep our brand alive round the year. Now with the UAE T20 League, we have acquired the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders. We also made a big investment in the US MLC where we were involved from the inception of the idea. We’ll be setting up LA Knight Riders and we’re also building a stadium.</p> <p>How much have you invested in the US MLC?</p> <p>The specifics and investments are still being finalized, but the way it works there is that the model is different from other leagues because in US sports, particularly in the National Football League, the franchises collectively own the league. Becoming part owner of a league is interesting. The launch of the league is contemplated for June-July of 2023 and it may not be a full-fledged tournament depending on infrastructure and, as it happens, newer venues keep getting added.</p> <p>How will the squad selection happen for the US team?</p> <p>The US and the UAE leagues are similar in many ways. We don’t typically have the type of local players that IPL or CPL have. So, it will be primarily international players to start with but there will be a requirement for a certain number of local players so that you invest in their development. We will also work on other aspects of player development such as academies, scouting, and grassroots programmes, both in the US and the UAE.</p> <p>Is there enough cricket viewership in the US?</p> <p>Interestingly, the US ranks number two in digital consumption of cricket content, after India. There’s a huge market... may be made up primarily of the diaspora to start with. The best way to describe the US market is that we’re looking at the number one media market in the world combined with the second most watched sport. For us, to scale LA Knight Riders in the medium to long term, we must get average American sports fan interested in T20 cricket or cricket in general.</p> <p>What’s the idea behind acquiring so many sporting leagues?</p> <p>Our vision was always to acquire other assets similar to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) around the world which we could own and operationalise. The assets should be timed in a way where we could create a caravan model so that we start at one place, go on to the other, and so on.</p> <p>Has that played out well?</p> <p>Yes, about eight seasons ago we went into the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) where we acquired the Trinidad franchise and we call it Trinbago Knight Riders or TKR. This happens during the months of August and September. We’d already taken this step before anybody else had even thought of it. The IPL was a two-month product and we had to figure out how to take the high-decibel event and keep our brand alive round the year. Now with the UAE T20 League, we have acquired the Abu Dhabi franchise, Abu Dhabi Knight Riders. We also made a big investment in the US in Major League Cricket (MLC) where we were involved from the inception of the idea itself. We’ll be setting up LA Knight Riders there and are also building a stadium.</p> <p>So Knight Riders will have cricket all year round.</p> <p>We’re probably the first and only cricket brand, which is global in white ball cricket. Starting January 2023, we’ll be playing in the UAE. In April-May, it will be Eden Gardens (IPL) and in June and July, we’ll play in LA. In August and September we’ll play in Trinidad. We’re very proud of this because this comes in after the initial years of making the first team a profitable brand. We were the first franchise to become profitable in 2011. All of us get a share of the media value, but the way we run our business in terms of maximizing revenue through good sponsorships, ticket revenues, home games, merchandising and licensing and other types of creative content development and the way we monetise that content, all of that has led to us becoming perhaps one of the most profitable franchises in the IPL.</p> <p>How will you spend the additional ₹480 crore you will get from BCCI for IPL media rights?</p> <p>Those are the types of numbers that we’re probably going to see and assuming that there are no other sort of expenses tacked on to us each of the franchises, no matter how your sponsorship works, it should become profitable.</p> <p>Will you consider going into other sports?</p> <p>It has to be a viable business proposition. We have to feel confident that we can operationally manage it. So, to that extent, we have somehow, by default, stuck to cricket.</p> <p>Are you planning to acquire or create a fifth sports franchise?</p> <p>Yes, we’ll see where it’s going to be. It could be a different line of business also. It may or may not be cricket. So, we will talk about this when we have a little bit more clarity on that.</p> <p>Will you consider listing Knight Riders?</p> <p>Going from a closely held company, which has become profitable and which is valuable right now, if our intention is to unlock value, I think there are other ways to do it than listing it. When the company is profitable, and the shareholders are getting good dividends, and there is enough money to fund our expansion, it doesn’t really make sense.</p> <p><a href="https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/us-ranks-at-number-two-on-digital-cricket-consumption-venky-mysore/amp-11658082531852.html">https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/us-ranks-at-number-two-on-digital-cricket-consumption-venky-mysore/amp-11658082531852.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JKKIDD231"> /u/JKKIDD231 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w757lg/us_ranks_at_number_two_on_digital_cricket/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w757lg/us_ranks_at_number_two_on_digital_cricket/">[comments]</a></span>
