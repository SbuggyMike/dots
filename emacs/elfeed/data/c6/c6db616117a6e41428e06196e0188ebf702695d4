<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I have been wanting to use Notion ever since switching to linux. Unfortunately none of the other apps like <a href="https://github.com/puneetsl/lotion">Lotion</a> come close or have stopped development. So I was out of luck. Until today. </p> <p>Today I decided to test if notion installs through WINE (I didn&#39;t see why it would not since programs like marvelousdesigner 3 work fine) and just for the luls. Turns out it does. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/R3BNAgx.png">Behold ye mighty and despair</a></p> <p>So for those of you who like to use notion for their workflow, it works and you don&#39;t need an official Linux version either.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/conan--cimmerian"> /u/conan--cimmerian </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13hql95/notion_finally_works_on_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13hql95/notion_finally_works_on_linux/">[comments]</a></span>
