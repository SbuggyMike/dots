<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In an attempt to actually talk about chess as well as twitter drama and how best to sac your queen, what does your opening repertoire look like and how did it come to be that way? Feel free to respond in as little or as much detail as you like, but I’ll add some prompts below to provide some ideas. Partially asking because I’m trying to decide on and learn some proper openings right now so cheers to all who contribute! </p> <p>Prompts: </p> <ul> <li><p>Do you always play the same first move? What openings are you comfortable going into from that move? How do you decide which of those openings to go into in a particular game? What’s the broad goal going into the mid game for that opening? </p></li> <li><p>Did you consciously build an opening repertoire or has it just developed naturally? What was the first opening you learned and how do you feel about it now? If you’ve changed openings at some point what prompted the change? </p></li> <li><p>When you’re black do you try and play a similar-ish plan most games or do you change a lot based on what your opponent is doing? Do you have specific plans that you like to play against specific openings from white? If so, how did you develop them? </p></li> </ul> <p>Might also be handy to state your rating for the sake of reference, but far from necessary if you’re not comfortable doing so. Hopefully this leads to some interesting discussions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Barak166"> /u/Barak166 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w88ekt/discussion_whats_your_opening_repertoire_like_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w88ekt/discussion_whats_your_opening_repertoire_like_and/">[comments]</a></span>
