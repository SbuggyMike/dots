<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wondering how to uninstall a package and ignore the dependencies it breaks.</p> <p>Specifically <code>jack2</code> while I&#39;m troubleshooting audio and microphone.</p> <p>I want to avoid a <code>pacman -Rsc</code> because I&#39;d end up with a broken system. If there was something like an Explicit or Ignore option to bypass the warnings for just the one package, that would be helpful</p> <p>What are your suggestions?</p> <p>EDIT:</p> <p>Thanks <a href="/u/needsleep31">u/needsleep31</a> - Love the user name.</p> <p>I removed jack2 with <code>pacman -Rdd jack2</code> Installed wireplumber and pulseaudio. Then as a secondary change, I made sure that both the internal Mic and the onboard Sound card were enabled.</p> <p>Rebooted after each update. Internal Mic is now working.</p> <p>EDIT 2: To be clear, I have already installed pipewire-jack</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomXUsr"> /u/RandomXUsr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/watu27/how_to_remove_a_package_jack2_and_break/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/watu27/how_to_remove_a_package_jack2_and_break/">[comments]</a></span>
