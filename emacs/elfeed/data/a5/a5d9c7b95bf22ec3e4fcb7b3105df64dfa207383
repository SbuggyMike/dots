<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For some reason this came into my mind..There is of course the famous Polg√°r sisters, on their peak form 2735 and 2577 (not simultaneusly I don&#39;t think, but they did take number 1 and 2 in top women, if ranking is the metric, gg). Any other couple of siblings beats that all time? (what if we account for rating inflation?)</p> <p>And active today? Jordan and Lucas Van Foreest im pretty sure right?Even Vaishali and Pragg are close to the top too maybe, or am I missing some obvious ones?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Amster2"> /u/Amster2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wapj0h/who_are_the_strongest_chess_siblings_playing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wapj0h/who_are_the_strongest_chess_siblings_playing/">[comments]</a></span>
