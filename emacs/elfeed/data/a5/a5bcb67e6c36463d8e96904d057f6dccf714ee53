*Internet freedom activists <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/earn-it-privacy-free-speech">warn Congress that the EARN IT act would
    eliminate internet freedom</a>.*
<p>
The stated goals of the EARN IT act seem proper to me, but 
the cost to freedom would be terrible, as adults would have to
prove their identities to get accounts on platforms,

  Another bill to protect "children" on the internet is called <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/advocates-pledge-support-for-landmark-bill-requiring-online-platforms-to-protect-kids-teens-with-safety-by-design-approach">KOSA</a>.
  The description of that bill seems to imply determining which users
are "children" but doesn't say how this would be done.  I fear the worst.
