<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to disable the splash screen by default when opening Emacs. Everything I tried from the many help threads for this very problem failed, so I tried <code>C-h v inhibit-startup-screen</code> to see if these variables were indeed being set correctly. In fact, the value of <code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> was <code>nil</code>, and it is being set by <code>startup.el</code>.</p> <p>How can I have <code>startup.el</code> not overwrite my Emacs configuration file?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CountMoosuch"> /u/CountMoosuch </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3fl6k/startupel_overwriting_variables_in_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3fl6k/startupel_overwriting_variables_in_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
