Putin's growing authoritarianism started <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/08/vladimir-putin-russia-culture-writers-ukraine-war">driving the leading artists
    of Russian culture</a> out of Russia even before he started attacking
Ukraine.  Now the only major artists that remain in Russia are those
who wish to flaunt their support for Putin's regime.

Recall how Putin used to mock the idea that other Russians could run against
him in elections?
    It wasn't enough for him that he was popular and would win even a free
election.  It wasn't enough for him to make victory for his opponents
impossible.    He went out of his way to <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2007-nov-feb.html#26%20January%202008%20(Russian%20elections)">rig elections</a> <em>blatantly</em>
(for instance, against Kasparov) so as to disparage the very idea of democracy.
