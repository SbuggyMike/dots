<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>So I am quite puzzeled by this. I&#39;m trying to install Arch on an Intel NUC. The USB stick doesn&#39;t get recognized when I boot the machine. Only when I switch to legacy BIOS mode it works, but I don&#39;t want that.</p> <p>When I use the stick in a different machine, it works. I have also tried several different sticks to no luck.</p> <p>ALSO, when I burn a diffrent iso like tails linux it works fine in UEFI mode. This is weird, isnt it? There is something about my specific combination of this NUC and the archiso.</p> <p>Any ideas how I could solve this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gebildebrot"> /u/gebildebrot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyr9yz/archiso_not_working_in_uefi_but_only_in_legacy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyr9yz/archiso_not_working_in_uefi_but_only_in_legacy/">[comments]</a></span>
