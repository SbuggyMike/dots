How
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/private-jets-subsidized-by-working-people">Americans and American cities</a>
subsidize the private jets of the
super-rich.
<p>
We effectively subsidize lots of other things for them too, mainly by
charging them far too little tax.  They pay a lower fraction of their
income in tax than most Americans. 
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2015-sep-dec.html#01_December_2015_(Nation_building)">It is fair for them to pay a much
higher fraction</a>,
because they can cope with that share of the country's needs.
