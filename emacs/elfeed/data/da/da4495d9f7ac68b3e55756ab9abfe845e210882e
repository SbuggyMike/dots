<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been tearing my hair out a bit here. I have a Huion WH1409 v2 with the wireless pen. It has worked perfectly fine in the past with Sway but it has been several months since I&#39;ve used it. I&#39;ve reinstalled arch between then and now so I&#39;m not sure if I had any special tricks in place, but I don&#39;t think I did. This issue occurs both with a usb connection and wireless dongle.</p> <p>Now, I plug it in, and I can put the pen close to move the cursor, even draw a few strokes, but as soon as I lift the pen out of proximity, Sway stops registering input completely until I replug it.</p> <p>I am on kernel 5.18.15</p> <p>dmesg produces no output of relevance, however I did find something interesting. I can do the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>Plug in tablet</p></li> <li><p>Start <code>sudo libinput debug-events</code></p></li> <li><p>Move pen close, wave it around, draw strokes. Receive proper output.</p></li> <li><p>Move the pen away, output stops completely even if you bring the pen back to the tablet. This is where it stops working in Sway as well</p></li> <li><p>Start up a fresh <code>sudo libinput debug-events</code></p></li> <li><p>Wave the pen around and the tablet spits out events as expected while the original instance remains dead</p></li> <li><p>Even after bring then pen out and back into proximity, it continues to read events properly in the new libinput monitor but still nothing in sway</p></li> </ul> <p>So the system is definitely still receiving events but it seems to choke as soon as you leave proximity the first time after the device is initialized. I saw one other post that described the exact same problem but it was deleted with zero comments.</p> <p>Anyone else seen this, and if so do you know how to fix it?</p> <p>EDIT: I was able to replicate this on my laptop running Sway as well, kernel 5.18.3</p> <p>EDIT 2: I was able to reproduce under Xorg with LxQt as well</p> <p>EDIT 3: A workaround! for anyone who is encountering this and stumbles across this post. It seems this only breaks for existing processes (including your desktop session of whatever DE/WM you use). To get it working currently, just tap your tablet with the pen before logging in or starting your GUI to trigger the issue in advance and avoid it during your session. If you&#39;re in a TTY, make sure to open up libinput debug-events or any other program that accepts input to trigger it. I posted an issue on the digimend tracker as well: <a href="https://github.com/DIGImend/digimend-kernel-drivers/issues/626">https://github.com/DIGImend/digimend-kernel-drivers/issues/626</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Posting____At_Night"> /u/Posting____At_Night </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wd7hwc/huion_graphics_tablet_stops_working_after_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wd7hwc/huion_graphics_tablet_stops_working_after_the/">[comments]</a></span>
