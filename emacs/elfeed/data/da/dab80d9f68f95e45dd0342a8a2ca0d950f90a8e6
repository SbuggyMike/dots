<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am facing a wierd issue both in a VM and bare metal Arch Linux installation. I mostly use Gnome so I didn&#39;t notice it before but recently when I switched to a tiling window manager I observed a wierd issue, in gnome scrolling through text is smooth in text editors namely Neovim, Emacs and VS Code however when I installed awesome wm continuous scrolling through text either vertically or horizontally was slow or laggy even in terminal even though everything else was so snappy. At first I thought it was due to Wayland but then I tested sway and hyprland and they had the same issue infact other desktop environments beside Gnome namely KDE Plasma and Xfce both had the same issue. In Gnome text scrolling is smooth even on Xorg so its not related to wayland. I haven&#39;t tested any other distro since Arch Linux is my favourite so I am not sure if this issue is exclusive to Arch or is same in other distros as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shans10"> /u/shans10 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0acxk/laggyslow_text_scrolling_except_in_gnome/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0acxk/laggyslow_text_scrolling_except_in_gnome/">[comments]</a></span>
