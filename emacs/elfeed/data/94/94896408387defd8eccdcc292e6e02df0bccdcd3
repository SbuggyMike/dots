<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically title. I can activate the env like normal but then I can&#39;t import any packages. It appears that the actual virtual env directories are untouched, python is just having trouble finding the packages. I can still activate and use python itself.</p> <p>Thanks for any help, really need those environments to be working lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Frogmutt"> /u/Frogmutt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138n8x3/full_system_upgrade_just_killed_all_my_python/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138n8x3/full_system_upgrade_just_killed_all_my_python/">[comments]</a></span>
