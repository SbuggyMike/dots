<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For quite a while, I haven&#39;t seen any cricket posts in <a href="/r/sports">r/sports</a> despite many noteworthy matches and moments. I tried posting Stubbs&#39;s catch, but it got removed twice. Is it due to copyright issues? I know cricket broadcasters are dicks who won&#39;t let people to even share clips.</p> <p>I messaged the mods about it, but did not get any reply. That catch definitely deserves a post, so if anyone here can, please try it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooRobots6923"> /u/SnooRobots6923 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wg19tw/why_are_cricket_posts_being_removed_in_rsports/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wg19tw/why_are_cricket_posts_being_removed_in_rsports/">[comments]</a></span>
