<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all!</p> <p>I&#39;m attempting to write my own custom backend which reads from an org file, grabs all the top-level headings and displays them in the company-mode popup as selection candidates. </p> <p>I have this working pretty well, but I was wondering if it was possible to (once the candidate has been selected) have the insert text (what actually gets placed <em>into</em> the buffer) changed or otherwise manipulated in some other way so that the value is different from the selection candidate.</p> <p>I was under the impression <code>post-completion</code> would allow this, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work. Here&#39;s my <code>defun</code>:</p> <pre><code>(defun company-sample-backend (command &amp;optional arg &amp;rest ignored) (interactive (list &#39;interactive)) (let ((people (org-ql-select (concat org-dir &quot;/contacts.org&quot;) &#39;(level 1) :action #&#39;org-get-heading))) (cl-case command (interactive (company-begin-backend &#39;company-sample-backend)) (prefix (and (eq major-mode &#39;org-mode) (company-grab-symbol))) (candidates (my/contacts-candidates arg)) (post-completion (company-thing arg))))) </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/codethrasher"> /u/codethrasher </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wd0n8b/custom_company_backends_different_insert_value_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wd0n8b/custom_company_backends_different_insert_value_to/">[comments]</a></span>
