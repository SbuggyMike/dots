<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/03/brazilian-police-search-jair-bolsonaro-mansion-arrest-aide">investigating Bolsonaro</a>,
accusing him of counterfeiting
a Covid-19 vaccination certificate.*
<p>
This is bizarre, because Bolsonaro says he proudly refused to be vaccinated
and never claimed otherwise.
<p>
He visited the US on a special head-of-state visa.  Maybe heads of state
are not asked to prove vaccination.
<p>
It is idiotic not to be vaccinated, unless you have some specific
medical problem which contraindicates vaccination.  Please don't
believe the disinformation which cherry-picks occasional problems with
this vaccine and exaggerates their significance, while minimizing the
continued danger of catching Covid-19.
