<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just upgraded gnupg to 2.4.1 via homebrew (on osx) and started freezing my emacs whenever I was saving encrypted files or needing to decrypt things. </p> <p>At first I thought it was an emacs upgrade issue 29.0.60 and deprecated to 28.x but noticed I stlll had the problem in the 28 branch or even upgrading to 29.0.90. </p> <p>I downgraded my homebrew version of gnupg to 2.4.0 which has fixed the problem but wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced the issue (or leave some google juice here for other people who might be scratching their head over the problem.</p> <p>I should mention I am on OSX Ventura and an M1 chipped macbook air, but curious if other people have run into this. (note: this is happening in org-mode with the standard org-crypt config and especially an ecnrypted org-journal.). </p> <p>More to the point, does anyone know what may be causing this? At some point, I&#39;d like to upgrade back up to 2.4.1. =] </p> <p>thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wakatara"> /u/wakatara </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/137r7j7/gnupg_241_encryption_issues_with_emacs_orgmode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/137r7j7/gnupg_241_encryption_issues_with_emacs_orgmode/">[comments]</a></span>
