They will be self posts by them (or automod if they&#39;d prefer) that will give a short outline of the council, current state and what they think may happen. I&#39;m sure some will be essays and some will just be short posts with basics - I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll thank them all because something is better than nothing. We can then reference them as the results come in. I&#39;ll link to them all here as well.</p> <p><em>If there are any previews you would like then you can make comment in this post with the council name and why you&#39;d like a preview and hopefully someone will agree to do it (I&#39;ll try and pick up a couple myself).</em></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/130kz33/local_elections_2023_previews_norwich/">Norwich Council Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/130tlv2/local_elections_2023_preview_cambridge_city/">Cambridge City Council Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/130ymhp/locals_2023_preview_sunderland/">Sunderland city council Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/130zzlh/local_elections_2023_previews_southampton/">Southampton City Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/13105p0/tandridge_district_council_election_preview/">Tandridge District Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1314tgp/local_elections_2023_previews_broadland_district/">Broadland District Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/131kr5o/locals_2023_preview_warwick_district_council/">Warwick District Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/131nbnc/locals_2023_preview_hereford_council/">Herefordshire Council Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1321yu6/election_preview_east_herts_council/">East Hertfordshire Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/132703c/local_elections_2023_previews_east_riding_of/">East Riding of Yorkshire Preview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/132mvqb/locals_2023_preview_central_bedfordshire/">Central Bedfordshire Preview</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/whencanistop"> /u/whencanistop </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/130i3k7/ukpol_does_local_elections_may_4th_2023/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/130i3k7/ukpol_does_local_elections_may_4th_2023/">[comments]</a></span>
