<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks, my bat broke today and I’d love some advice on getting a new one.</p> <p>I got a semi expensive bat ($350) after mostly making do with cheaper ones and it was a game changer - I really loved playing with it. Unfortunately it was a very uncommon brand and none of the stores in my new city (or online) seem to have it.</p> <p>Sadly I’m an unrepentant slogger and after 18 months of use it finally cracked near the splice and nearly split in two. I almost always middle the ball (edges are clean) but don’t always time it and swing hard every time. Obviously very heavy bottom hand.</p> <p>I have zero footwork but good hand eye coordination for my level (us club cricket). I primarily play on the back foot or on the up (im good with short pitched bowling and my hands are good enough to play pitched up bowling on the up without much foot movement at my level). I either open the batting to simply clear the infield or come down the order to score quick runs. I don’t hit many sixes but score 4s easily when I’m batting well.</p> <p>As I am primarily a bowler getting good performance out of the bat is great but I would prefer it to last a while. I practice in the nets (20 mins batting) and play weekend matches.</p> <p>So assuming a max budget of USD500 (but i need the bat to last at least 2 years) what spec bat would you recommend? Or would two bats (one for practice and one for match be better) Specifically the following parameters:</p> <ol> <li>Grade of Willow</li> <li>Weight of bat</li> <li>Grains on face</li> <li>Brand</li> <li>Tradeoffs on Dimensions (e.g. toe width, edge width, concaving etc)</li> </ol> <p>If you have a particular model or brand you like please recommend!</p> <p>Thanks! Let me know if you have any questions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dorba88"> /u/Dorba88 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/vzg7z2/advice_on_buying_a_new_bat_for_a_slogger/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/vzg7z2/advice_on_buying_a_new_bat_for_a_slogger/">[comments]</a></span>
