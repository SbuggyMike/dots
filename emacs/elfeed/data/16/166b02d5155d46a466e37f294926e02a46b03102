<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Using texlab, either with VSCode (through extension) or NeoVim (built-in LSP). Everything works well, except inverse search (ctrl-click in pdf sends you to the line in the TeX document). I have followed the instructions <a href="https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab/blob/master/docs/previewing.md#zathura">here</a>, for example, for VSCode. Every time I ctrl-click on the pdf in zathura, <code>code</code> with dump core, and there is no inverse lookup. Same thing happens with neovim. What is peculiar is that it is the receiving end (code or neovim) dumps core, so I have no idea what is going on.</p> <p>Can anyone confirm whether this is an issue on their end, and/or offer and suggestions? Happy to give more info.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/coxackie_"> /u/coxackie_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8fz9m/texlab_inverse_search_with_zathura_leads_to_core/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8fz9m/texlab_inverse_search_with_zathura_leads_to_core/">[comments]</a></span>
