<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Upon hearing Daphnis et Chloe&#39;s interlude in the famous recording by Pierre Boulez and Berlin Phil, and performed by an actual choir, I fell in love with it. I also love Neptune, and the choir in it. Does anyone have any recommendations for similar ominous works, particularly with choir?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BabishProphet"> /u/BabishProphet </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wcwqyw/ominous_choral_stuff/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wcwqyw/ominous_choral_stuff/">[comments]</a></span>
