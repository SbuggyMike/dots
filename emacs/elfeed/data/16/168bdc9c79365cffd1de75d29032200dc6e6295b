To be a good parent requires fighting now to

from destroying them</a>
later in their lives.

The article reiterates a basic assumption -- that you should love,
care about, your own children more than anyone else.  Carried too far,
that narrow focus is a mistake.  A saying that struck me as very wise
is, "Helping only your own family is a just a form of selfishness."
This can be see in the way billionaires are practicing precisely that
form of selfishness when they try to take all the world's wealth for
their own heirs.

Notwithstanding that, the article's overall point is valid.  But I
would take it one step further.  Nowadays the best thing you can do
for your potential children is not to have them.
