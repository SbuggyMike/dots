<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, does anyone know if there&#39;s an option to prevent message-mode auto expanding plain text attachments? I recently started contributing to a project that uses mailing lists. I manage my mail with notmuch, but I&#39;m finding it very hard to focus on the content of my messages whe reading when I inadvertently scroll into a large attachment such as a patch. I&#39;d prefer to just keep these minimised by default like pdf attachments and expand them if I&#39;m interested. Anyone know how?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/emax-gomax"> /u/emax-gomax </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w761d3/how_to_automatically_collapse_attachments_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w761d3/how_to_automatically_collapse_attachments_in/">[comments]</a></span>
