<p>I'm searching for a commercial product that enables commenting on HTML elements on a product so it can be shared with an org. Think google comments connected to Inspect Element in chrome that can be shared with an organization.<p>I want to get away from creating tickets or sending emails highlighting UX concerns. This is cumbersome and not very transparent or collaborative.<p>Does a tool like this already exist?</p>
