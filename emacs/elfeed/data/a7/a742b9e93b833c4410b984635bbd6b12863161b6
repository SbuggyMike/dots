<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a Wyse thin client that is running arch linux. I need to set up a mount point to an Unraid server I have running on a computer on the same network (my home one). I am relatively new to all this, and am having difficulty finding a decent guide to how to do that in the most direct and simple way. I know that samba is used to connect to Windows computers, but I am also seeing things that indicate I should use an NFS connection of some sort and edit the fstab file. If I know that my Unraid server is at xxx.xxx.x.xxx, what is the mount command (or sequence of commands) I should use? Again, I&#39;m very new to this, so please be patient with me!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/koddian"> /u/koddian </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbpiky/accessing_computer_running_unraid_from_wyse_thin/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbpiky/accessing_computer_running_unraid_from_wyse_thin/">[comments]</a></span>
