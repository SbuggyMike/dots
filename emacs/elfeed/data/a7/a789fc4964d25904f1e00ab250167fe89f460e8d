<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all! Despite my several year usage of Linux and passion for programming, I&#39;ve not yet delved into the depths of several aspects of Linux itself. I&#39;m working on that now.</p> <p>As I come across environment variables, it strikes me that there&#39;s so much potential! And it strikes me as interesting that they&#39;re not typed whatsoever (useful for quick/dirty scripts, for sure). </p> <p>I&#39;ve not had much success in searching (although I found GNU&#39;s Guile, which looks interesting; maybe not entirely related) but I&#39;m interested to know:</p> <p>What is the state of the art in using environment variables for more sophisticated scripts/programming? It seems, for example, that we could create an entire DSL (Domain Specific Language) within such variables that could be changed at runtime -- it seems that having these variables typed would be of interest, it seems that error-checking would be desirable (e.g., if we set an environment variable in a way that depends on an external network call, we want to know if it failed or not) -- again, it seems that there&#39;d be so much potential! </p> <p>I&#39;m certain I&#39;m not the first to think of this, so I&#39;m wondering what experience in these matters exist. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ellipsoider"> /u/Ellipsoider </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vyam1s/state_of_the_art_in_usage_of_environment/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vyam1s/state_of_the_art_in_usage_of_environment/">[comments]</a></span>
