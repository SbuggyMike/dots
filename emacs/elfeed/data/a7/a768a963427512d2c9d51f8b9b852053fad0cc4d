Last time I tried (many years ago), trying to log into the Plasma Wayland session just popped me straight back to the display manager. As it has been several years, I want to try it out again.
The computer I did this on is a conventional desktop PC with a mouse and keyboard, along with a Wacom drawing tablet. The GPU is a Radeon 460.
Overall it's the same at best and somewhat broken at worst.
