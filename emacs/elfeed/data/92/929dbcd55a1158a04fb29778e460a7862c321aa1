<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Preface: I don&#39;t have AUCTeX installed.</p> <p>I have all setup so that a makefile compiles a latex file and creates a pdf. I also setup pdf-tools and synctex. I would like to bind to a key a functions that start to compile, wait for the result, if there is no error from make then it displays in a separate buffer the pdf, else it displays the buffer with the error (which are on stdout because I redirect them and grep the important bits).</p> <p>The makefile is important because there are other scripts that modify the latex before actual rendering. It also makes the setup more friendly with only the terminal.</p> <p>My experience with lisp is unfortunately very small, any suggestions for resources to read are welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/acidoglutammico"> /u/acidoglutammico </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whz25y/noob_question_about_compiling_viewing_pdf/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whz25y/noob_question_about_compiling_viewing_pdf/">[comments]</a></span>
