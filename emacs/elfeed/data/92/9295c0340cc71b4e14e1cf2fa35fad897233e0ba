<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So during installation I was just finishing up and wanted to give the root password so I typed passwd, typed the password and pressed enter bit nothing happened. I also tried ctrl+c and still nothing.</p> <p>After 20 secs like that I pressed the poweroff button and booted again, mounted the partition chrooted runed passwd and everything worked.</p> <p>Now my question is: Can I still run the system with the fact that I shuted down with my partitions mounted and passwd running without problems? Or should I reinstall?</p> <p>EDIT: I know that it&#39;s prob ok since I haven&#39;t seen any errors but still wanted some second hand opinion on the matter.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CronyAkatsuki"> /u/CronyAkatsuki </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w147tl/shutdown_during_installation_process/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w147tl/shutdown_during_installation_process/">[comments]</a></span>
