<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have listened to his 9th, 4th, 7th, and 8th symphonies so far. I feel so torn because I listen to his 7th symphony and I hear the work of pure musical mastery, it is such a beautiful symphony and I love it. </p> <p>I listen to his other symphonies and I’m just left underwhelmed, but I can tell there’s something there that I’m not appreciating. </p> <p>I want to understand Bruckner more because I felt the same way about Mahler’s music, so what pieces or movements helped you appreciate Bruckner’s music? Thank you in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/0neMoreYear"> /u/0neMoreYear </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/we3o16/help_me_understand_bruckner/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/we3o16/help_me_understand_bruckner/">[comments]</a></span>
