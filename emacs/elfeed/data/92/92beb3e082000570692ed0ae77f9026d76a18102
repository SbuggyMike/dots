  After one too many blatant lies, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/05/boris-johnson-indefensible-cabinet-accomplices">two Tory ministers resigned</a> rather
  than continue serving alongside Bogus Johnson.

  Subsequently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/05/ill-lose-my-seat-anyway-from-cabinet-to-the-backbenches-how-johnsons-support-ebbed-away">other ministers joined them</a>.  The rest continue
  supporting Bogus, lacking even that minimum level of integrity.  But
  the ones that resigned just now sat still for lie after lie.
