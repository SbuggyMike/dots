The US government must fund <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/29/managed-retreat/">"managed" retreat</a> from housing that is doomed
to be flooded or burnt.
<p>
The people who live in those homes can't afford to move or build
elsewhere &mdash; the government must help them.  But subsidizing
rebuilding in place is an enormously inefficient way to do that.

I disagree with the statement that "managed retreat is not defeat."
Of course it is!  <a href="/glossary.html#global%20heating">Global heating</a> disaster will be one defeat after
another.  However, there are different kinds of defeats.  When you
can't win the battle, an orderly retreat is much less bad than a
disorderly rout, and that's what will happen if we don't plan this.
