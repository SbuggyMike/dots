<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ever since apple started shipping Macs with their own Arm CPU’s, it’s been a game changer. My question is, is it that good simply because of how it was designed or does MacOS have something to do with its performance? If so, how will a project like Asahi Linux fair when we compare the two? I would love to see your opinions on this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Feisty-Republic-2098"> /u/Feisty-Republic-2098 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wepqy1/is_apple_silicon_any_good/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wepqy1/is_apple_silicon_any_good/">[comments]</a></span>
