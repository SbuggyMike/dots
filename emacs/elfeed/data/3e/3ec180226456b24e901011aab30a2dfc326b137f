This is an extreme case of thugs' frequent practice of assuming a
black man is guilty of something, simply because he's black.  They
knew the suspect was white,

The article linked to just above displays symbolic bigotry by
capitalizing "black" but not "white".  (To avoid endorsing bigotry,
capitalize both words or neither one.)  I object to bigotry, and
normally I will not link to articles that promote it.  But I make
exceptions for some articles that I consider particularly important.
That article is one of the exceptions.
