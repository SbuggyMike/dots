<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For some context: I am about a 1200-rated casual player, and over the last 6 months I have had some of the most infuriating losses since I started playing online chess. My losses were not the result of being in a bad position nor were the result of a dumb blunder. Instead, the losses came in absolute winning positions on <a href="https://chess.com">chess.com</a>. The losses came because <a href="https://chess.com">chess.com</a> said I &quot;abandoned the game&quot; (often times with 5-7 minutes left in a 10-minute game).</p> <p>I live in a place where there is spotty internet, so in the past, when <a href="https://chess.com">chess.com</a> said I am disconnected, I had to rigorously disconnect from my wifi and reconnect to continue the game. I could live with this, and I did so for 3-4 years playing on the website. But in the last 6 months, <a href="https://chess.com">chess.com</a> does not even prompt me sometimes if I disconnect. If my internet disconnects for 15-30 seconds, I am booted for abandoning. Frustrating. </p> <p>If you have crappy internet like me, try using Lichess. So far it has been seamless for me, and the moves seem to be more streamlined. This definitely is helping my blood pressure when I don&#39;t constantly see &quot;abandoned game&quot; losses. </p> <p>Just a note: This is not an advertisement nor am I affiliated with any of these websites. I am just hoping to help someone that was in my position. </p> <p>Also, I hope everyone is enjoying the Chess Olympiad.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Simpcastergage"> /u/Simpcastergage </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/we3dyz/if_you_are_having_connectionabandoned_game_issues/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/we3dyz/if_you_are_having_connectionabandoned_game_issues/">[comments]</a></span>
