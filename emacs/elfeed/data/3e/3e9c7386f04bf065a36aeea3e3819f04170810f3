<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Bowlers get absolutely no love. You could get 4 wickets with 9 runs given in a goddamn ODI and some batsman with an 80 plus score will win MOTM. I&#39;m too lazy to do the analysis, but if you looked at MOTMs won by batting performances vs bowling the divide would be wild. I don&#39;t even need to run stats to say that.</p> <p>And yet, time and again, it&#39;s the team with better bowlers that wins when games matter most. &quot;Defense wins championships&quot;.</p> <p>Let&#39;s just do away with one man of the match. Let&#39;s pick batsmen and bowler of the match instead. It will also allow performances on a losing side to get more recognition.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DumbNBANephew"> /u/DumbNBANephew </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w2djhr/do_we_need_to_do_away_with_man_of_the_match_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w2djhr/do_we_need_to_do_away_with_man_of_the_match_and/">[comments]</a></span>
