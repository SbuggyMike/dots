An IPCC publication comparing the effectiveness of various ways of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/20/down-to-earth-ipcc-emissions">reducing greenhouse gas emissions</a>
  finds that the five most effective methods are:
<ul>
<li>solar power</li>
<li>wind power</li>
<li>ending deforestation</li>
<li>improving energy efficiency (what Amory Lovins called "negawatts")</li>
<li>shutting off methane emissions</li>
</ul?
In particular, nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage
are of little use.
