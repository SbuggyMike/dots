<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use evil mode with emacs and in order to scroll up with <code>C-u</code> like in vim you need to set this variable. I have <code>(setq evil-want-C-u-scroll t)</code> in my config (before enabling evil mode, and before requiring it (if that&#39;s even needed)) but it doesn&#39;t work.</p> <p>Does someone know why? I know I could set the bindings manually but that&#39;s not very clean and I&#39;d prefer to use this built-in variable if possible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooPets20"> /u/SnooPets20 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wixznq/evilwantcuscroll_not_getting_respected/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wixznq/evilwantcuscroll_not_getting_respected/">[comments]</a></span>
