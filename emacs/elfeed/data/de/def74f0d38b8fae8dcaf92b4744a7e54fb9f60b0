<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>last night I installed arch linux an my new pc, which comes with preinstalled windows 11. Linux and windows are installed on two different ssds. I&#39;ve chosen systemd-boot as a boot loader and followed <a href="https://vectops.com/2022/02/dual-booting-arch-linux-and-windows/">this instruction</a> to include windows in the boot loader menu.</p> <p>Everything is working, i can boot linux and windows, but, when I&#39;m in windows I can not shut down the pc, reboot is working properly. When I click on shutdown in windows, windows only logs me out and I get the login screen from windows.</p> <p>When I change the boot order and start windows from the windows boot loader everything is working fine.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jupper1"> /u/jupper1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/132ox9j/dual_boot_windows_cannot_shutdown/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/132ox9j/dual_boot_windows_cannot_shutdown/">[comments]</a></span>
