<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need to share this with people who will understand. </p> <p>Last night I went to a concert at the Edinburgh Festival: Beethoven’s 5th Piano Concerto (which I know well) and Shostakovich’s 10th Symphony (which I don’t know at all). I was disappointed in the slow movement of the concerto which seemed too fast and lacking in feeling, but it was rescued by a fine rendition of the final rondo. </p> <p>The programme notes led me to expect that the symphony would be a grim and harsh experience; that could not be farther from the truth. I was captivated from the opening notes. The sense of powerful rage and (at times) mocking anger almost moved me to tears. </p> <p>It is a phenomenal work, given a phenomenal performance. I was blown away. My wife who was with me felt the same but I know that none of my friends would understand so I needed to share the experience here, with an audience who might appreciate the wonder I just witnessed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shoogled"> /u/Shoogled </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wj22ga/shostakovich_10_an_awesome_work/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wj22ga/shostakovich_10_an_awesome_work/">[comments]</a></span>
