<p>&#8216;It has become cliché to say that modern familial arrangements are vastly different now to how they were 50 years ago, but that does not make it any less true.

With the passage of the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Act 2013, and the Civil Partnership (Opposite Sex Couples) Regulations 2019, the range of relationships that can be legally recognised, and the form that this recognition takes are also very different. Given the age of many settlements, traditional definitions of “children” or “spouse” can cause real difficulties.&#8217;</p>
