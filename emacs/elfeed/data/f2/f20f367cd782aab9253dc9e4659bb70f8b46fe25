Cory Doctorow explains how the rootkit that attacks treacherous
computing is a <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/28/descartes-was-an-optimist/#uh-oh">disaster for "security"</a> in the usual sense.
<p>
It means that machines with the WHAT? can now have additional <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-back-doors.html">back doors</a> 
other than the one that Microsoft designed into Windows.
<p>
However, since WHAT is what ensures we can't free our machines from
Microsoft's control, the same vulnerability that this rootkit uses
might give us a way to turn off treacherous computing and/or install
our own free boot software.
