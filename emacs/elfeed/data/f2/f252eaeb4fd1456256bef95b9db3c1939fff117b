Legal advice received by the European Commission suggests that the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/08/eu-lawyers-plan-to-scan-private-messages-child-abuse-may-be-unlawful-chat-controls-regulation">"chat control" censorship plan is illegal</a>.
<p>
The plan assumes that an encrypted communication service _includes_
nonfree software to run on your machine to send and receive messages.
That implies that the service can make that software snoop on your
communications before it encrypts them.
<p>
That design, where the service imposes specific software on users,
is fundamentally unjust and insecure, precisely because the service
imposes nonfree software on users and users can never rationally trust
such software.
<p>
In effect, the "chat control" plan demonstrates that we were right.  A
service that makes users run nonfree software to talk with it is
inherently insecure and untrustworthy.
