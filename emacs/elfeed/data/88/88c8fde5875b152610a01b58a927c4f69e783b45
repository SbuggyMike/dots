<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Specifically the first movement of 1, and the fourth of 2. I think the best word to describe those movements for me is majestic. I haven’t heard any other pieces that do it quite as well as these two. Sibelius’ later symphonies just don’t quite have the same feel as those two movements of his first 2. Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AsymmetricSquid"> /u/AsymmetricSquid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/132baee/something_like_sibelius_12/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/132baee/something_like_sibelius_12/">[comments]</a></span>
