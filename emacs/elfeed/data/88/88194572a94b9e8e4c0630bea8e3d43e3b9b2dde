<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It always intrigues me that Voyager was sent out into space with a selection of music to represent humanity. If you were picking 5 classical pieces to be launched into the infinite, what would you choose to show us (or western art music) at our best? Here are my choices:</p> <ul> <li>Dufay - Missa <em>se la face ay pal</em><br/></li> <li>Bach - Mass in B minor</li> <li>Mozart - Marriage of Figaro</li> <li>Beethoven - Piano Sonata No.32, Opus 111</li> <li>Debussy - La Mer</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zumaro"> /u/zumaro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/133ige6/5_pieces_to_represent_us_to_the_cosmos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/133ige6/5_pieces_to_represent_us_to_the_cosmos/">[comments]</a></span>
