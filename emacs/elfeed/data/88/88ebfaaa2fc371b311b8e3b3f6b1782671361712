The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/15/asia/sri-lanka-crisis-economy-fix-gotabaya-rajapaksa-saturday-intl-hnk/index.html">establishment view of what is needed to "fix" Sri Lanka</a>.
Its idea of what "fixing" means does not include enabling the country
to save the non-rich.
<p>
The IMF does not "bail out" countries to save them.  Rather, it gives
them a chance to sell themselves into slavery.  For instance, it has a
long history of imposing "structural adjustments" that <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2018-mar-jun.html#10_June_2018_(IMF_imposing_hardship_on_non-rich)">reduce the
incomes of the non-rich</a>, <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-jan-apr.html#22_April_2011_(Honduran_Destruction)">require payment for public education</a>, and
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2007-jul-oct.html#13%20October%202007%20(Payments%20to%20the%20IMF)">destroy public health programs</a>.
<p>
I think Sri Lanka's only chance is to make the west and China compete
to offer a deal that doesn't enslave the country.
<p>
More generally, we need world systems that stop politicians from
stealing a country's income, sending it overseas, and leaving the
country and its non-rich crushed by debt.
