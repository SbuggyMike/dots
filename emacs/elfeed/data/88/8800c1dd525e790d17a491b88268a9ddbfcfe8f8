Missouri has imposed
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/04/1173274834/book-bans-library-funding-missouri-texas-ashcroft">censorship on children and teenagers</a>
using nearly
all libraries in the state.  The rule would deny state funding to any
library that allows a library user under age 18 to see books that are
not "age appropriate", or to check out a book that <a href="/articles/genderless-pronouns.html#nushell">per</a>
parents would not approve of.

A large fraction of people of age 17 and 16 have had sex, but Missouri
doesn't want them to read about books that address issues of sex or
sexual relationships.  "Heaven forbid they might learn something
pertinent to their lives."
