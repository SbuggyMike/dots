[so-called] AI facial
recognition on streets.*
<p>
I applaud the EU for even considering this, and I hope it passes.
<p>
Whether facial recognition should be considered "AI" is a tricky
question, which I think makes no difference to anything important.
Such systems should be prohibited, but the prohibition should not be
limited to facial recognition.  It should cover identification of
persons by any kind of sensing of personal characteristic.
<p>
Indeed, it should include collection of records from which it would be
straightforward to identify people later.
