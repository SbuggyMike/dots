<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve updated my system and rebooted and it halts on boot with several following dmesg entries:</p> <p><code>ata8: SATA link down(SStatus 0 SControl 300)</code></p> <p>Now this entry actually seems normal and I can find it in other journalctl boots, but I&#39;m not sure how to further troubleshoot it. Looking at the journalctl I am suspecting another message to be at fault:</p> <p><code>Timed out waiting for device /dev/virtio-ports/org.qemu.guest_agent.0.</code></p> <p>This message I cannot find in any other boot, and it is extra confusing since I do not have QEMU installed. I also tried installing QEMU just in case but that didn&#39;t do it either. I also have some I/O errors but those are present in older journals as well, so I didn&#39;t find them to be too suspicious.</p> <p>Looking at other threads on various forums, another suspect could be SATA-related hardware issues, but I can access the disks using a live boot usb. Would this eliminate the issue or is it still a potential problem? Additionally, I have turned on the computer an hour earlier without any issue, the only significant change is the update.</p> <p>I could use any additional help troubleshooting this and will update the question with additional info in case it is required.</p> <p>Since I saw other posters often provide their fstab file, here&#39;s mine:</p> <pre><code># /dev/sda3 UUID=fd8d7b61-04e0-49f5-b508-5791ba7c3633 / ext4 rw,relatime 0 1 # /dev/sda1 UUID=AB2A-9533 /boot vfat rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro 0 2 # /dev/sda2 UUID=ba36078b-eedf-455a-97b9-480206ecc1a3 none swap defaults 0 0 </code></pre> <p>Please let me know if I can provide any additional information relevant to the issue.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Edit 1:</p> <p>From comments a possible cause for this problem is the new update. I&#39;ve extracted the log of the upgraded packages in the update that crashed the system and saved it in a <a href="https://pastebin.com/afkjhnqx">pastebin</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ZlatSic"> /u/ZlatSic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcvbqs/boot_stuck_at_dmesgs_ata8_sata_link_down/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcvbqs/boot_stuck_at_dmesgs_ata8_sata_link_down/">[comments]</a></span>
