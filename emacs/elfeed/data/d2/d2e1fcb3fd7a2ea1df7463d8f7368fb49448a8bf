<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I have HP EliteBook 8440p with NVIDIA graphics card. Installed Arch KDE on this laptop, NVIDIA DKMS drivers are installed. I can&#39;t figure out what causes frames to drop when launching some things, like:</p> <ul> <li>calendar, when clicking on date/time on a panel</li> <li>maximizing/minimizing Firefox and Chrome (here I have lags)</li> <li>sometimes classic menu launcher lags the same way.</li> </ul> <p>The best way I can describe it is not smooth animations when launching, maximizing, or minimizing it. It is like it isn&#39;t 60fps, but between 5-20 FPS for some reason...</p> <p>Oddly enough, most KDE apps or other apps are running smoothly (dolphin, akregator, calculator for example). I tried Linux Mint, Gnome, XFCE, and there it looks way worse with all the desktop, so I stayed with KDE.</p> <p>It seems like not a big thing, but for me this is important, because I have a feeling of a little dissapointment, when I know that on Windows everything runs buttery smoot on the same machine.</p> <p>Can you point me in the direction of what can I do here to solve the issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry-Flatworm5965"> /u/Dry-Flatworm5965 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/139dron/what_causes_the_frames_drop_when_launching_some/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/139dron/what_causes_the_frames_drop_when_launching_some/">[comments]</a></span>
