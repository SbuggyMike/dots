<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry this is probably a very stupid question but I had an issue with <code>python-pygls 1.0.1-2</code> but seemed to have been fixed in <code>python-pygls 1.0.1-3</code>. Looking at the changes for that version I see nothing other than a bump of <code>pkgrel</code>. So am I missing something or is it only to trigger a rebuild for py311? </p> <p><a href="https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/commit/6d2842926ca575b0068045b67ad642e829b1b1c0">https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/commit/6d2842926ca575b0068045b67ad642e829b1b1c0</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AckslD"> /u/AckslD </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138tiqv/how_to_inspect_package_changes/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138tiqv/how_to_inspect_package_changes/">[comments]</a></span>
