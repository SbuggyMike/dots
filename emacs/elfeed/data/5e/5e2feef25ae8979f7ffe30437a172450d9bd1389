<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I plan on creating a USB drive with arch on it that can be used pretty much anywhere. Since I also want to add an NTFS partition so I can still use it as a regular USB drive I wonder if it&#39;s possible to use the second partition on a drive as a legacy boot partition.</p> <p>I would partition the USB drive like this: 1. NTFS (USB functionality) 2. FAT32 (legacy boot) 3. FAT32 (UEFI boot) 4. EXT4 (Linux)</p> <p>Windows sadly only shows the first partition on a USB drive when plugged in.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Trqhxrd"> /u/Trqhxrd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb2biv/position_of_a_legacy_boot_partition/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb2biv/position_of_a_legacy_boot_partition/">[comments]</a></span>
