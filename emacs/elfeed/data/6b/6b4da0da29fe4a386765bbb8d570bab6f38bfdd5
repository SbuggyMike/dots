<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A little background to provide some context:</p> <p>We have software developed in Acu Cobol currently running v10 that are distributed to clients on a CentOS7 installation, reason for using CentOS was always to save the client costs on commercial O/S licensing. We are looking at moving away from CentOS as, well CentOS7 is nearing its EOL - yes not for another 2 years, but I would like to be proactive, and the changes in CentOS to Stream being an an upstream to RHEL and a rolling update distro.</p> <p>Moving away from CentOS does pose a bit of challenge as requirements for me would be things like: 1. Still keeping inline with cost saving, it can’t be commercial licensed. 2. Unfrequent major releases, those of say Fedora and OpenSUSE which releases a new version every 6 - 12 months 3. With the above, long term support on releases for at least 5 years. 4. Learning curve for lesser technical support staff. 5. Some sort of deployment service to ensure standardisation (this is a nice to have)</p> <p>So I did what any pleppy would do, started searching around for Red Based systems as 1. I’m come from a RH/CentOS background and 2. Least to no impact on changes in operations…. yes, yes I know majority works the same regardless of distro.</p> <p>Of course the lists came back with: CentOS Stream (just NO) Almalinux Rockylinux Oracle Linux Fedora RHEL SLES OpenSUSE Ubuntu</p> <p>Right so, Fedora and OpenSUSE is a no go due to their frequent releases and short life cycle. I did like OpenSUSE but again short life cycle. Fedora….. I had a very bad experience with Fedora and have nor used it ever again and will most likely never use it again - it has been years and I am still not over it.</p> <p>RHEL and SLES are commercially licensed which would be great for the support aspect but then it would cost the clients more due to the licenses.</p> <p>So now my actual question, Alma vs Rocky: Both look great and I have tested both the distros with our software. As Acu Cobol v10 still has a 32-bit lib requirement it was a bit tricky getting the Acu environment to work but eventually did manage to get it running. My concern is, longevity especially as they are newer distros. I do understand both are RHEL based systems and also downstream from RHEL and also both have commercial backing, the distro age is what bothers me a bit</p> <p>I haven’t tested Oracle Linux yet but it would appear to meet the majority of the requirements, only concern is that it is Oracle - they do have a tendency to not always play nice</p> <p>Ubuntu, dear, dear Ubuntu - I have a mental block against them as I feel that they wanted to be too much like Windows in the olden days and something that I have also never gotten over so I have never used it and never really looked at, but their LTS, now, does look impressive.</p> <p>The point of my research question would be, how many community members have implemented either Rocky - or Almalinux in a production environment and what are /were your experience with it? Would you suggest or recommend it or would it better too get over myself and start looking at Ubuntu?</p> <p>Ubuntu might have a technical cost involved especially for the lesser skilled HD agents but looking at it, then again maybe not as they don’t really support in-depth functionality where differences in commands or file location are involved.</p> <p>Would be nice get input from from the community to complement the research and testing efforts already done</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Grumpy_1"> /u/The_Grumpy_1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vzr395/research_question_community_opinion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vzr395/research_question_community_opinion/">[comments]</a></span>
