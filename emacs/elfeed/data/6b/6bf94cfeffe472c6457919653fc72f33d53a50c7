<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Husband and I been married 8 months. He’s a huge cricket fan, and his birthday is coming in a week. I’ve decided to make a compilation of all historic events/milestones/major wins of his favourite cricket team, right from their inception to the current day. Now, the compilation consists of newspaper headlines and original article detailing the event, which I dug up from the archives online, printed it and made it into a scrapbook. So for every noteworthy incident, he has a copy of the newspaper article dating back to when it originally happened, and the description in chronological order. </p> <p>Is this meaningful enough, or have I gotten ahead of myself? I’m not sure if it would be a thoughtful gift, since I am not into sports myself idk how the person on the receiving end would feel. Any feedback is welcome, thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/knockknockwhoder"> /u/knockknockwhoder </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wjefsc/my_minds_in_two_pieces_about_the_gift_i_made_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wjefsc/my_minds_in_two_pieces_about_the_gift_i_made_for/">[comments]</a></span>
