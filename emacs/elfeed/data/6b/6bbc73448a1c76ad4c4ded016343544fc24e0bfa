<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use Doom which packages <a href="https://github.com/gilbertw1/better-jumper">better-jumper</a> and binds <code>better-jumper-jump-backward</code> to <code>C-o</code>. I use this binding extensively in my workflow and it mostly works well, but there are a few scenarios where jumping backwards doesn&#39;t seem to work.</p> <p>First, when I&#39;m in Org Agenda and press Enter on a todo item (<code>org-agenda-switch-to</code>) to go to the corresponding org file, I&#39;m unable to jump back to the Org Agenda buffer - <code>C-o</code> takes me to a seemingly random location. I tried fixing this with advice:</p> <p><code> (advice-add &#39;org-agenda-switch-to :before #&#39;better-jumper-set-jump) </code></p> <p>but the location in Org Agenda still doesn&#39;t seem to be in the jump list.</p> <p>Second, when in helpful mode (when looking up docs with e.g. <code>helpful-key</code> or <code>helpful-callable</code>) I can&#39;t figure out how to go back after following a link in the docs (i.e. after pressing Enter over a link). In helpful mode <code>better-jumper-jump-backward</code> just doesn&#39;t seem to do anything and I&#39;m at a loss as to how I&#39;m supposed to navigate.</p> <p>I&#39;d really appreciate any help from those more familiar with setting up these libraries than I am.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/polarbearwithagoatee"> /u/polarbearwithagoatee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132o8gd/getting_backwards_jumps_working_in_org_agenda_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132o8gd/getting_backwards_jumps_working_in_org_agenda_and/">[comments]</a></span>
