<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I specifically mean original pieces written for solo piano, so no transcriptions. There&#39;s tons of pieces by Ravel, Scriabin, and especially Debussy that do this, and there&#39;s obviously Liszt and Alkan. However, I&#39;ve seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56rapuxD6vc">beginning of the second section of Schumann&#39;s Humoreske, Op. 20</a> uses three staves as well, and that was written in 1839. Are there any earlier examples of original pieces for solo piano being so layered as to need three staves?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kranjskiburek"> /u/kranjskiburek </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/138zo41/what_are_the_earliest_instances_of_piano/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/138zo41/what_are_the_earliest_instances_of_piano/">[comments]</a></span>
