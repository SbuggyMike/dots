<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been dealing with this for about a month and a half now. I&#39;ve taken extended periods away from the keyboard (up to a few weeks), but every time I feel it&#39;s healed and go to my keyboard, the pain returns within a couple hours of typing. I had no idea this was common enough to have a name until today.</p> <p>I&#39;m not an Emacs user, but a couple of years ago, I discovered the magic of Vim. Then I discovered the magic of keyboard remapping. Soon after, I was blissfully navigating text in every program with just capslock and my trusty hjkl;0 keys. And now I have a capslock combination for every key on the right side of the keyboard (and alternate modes while holding caps and s,d, f, or g, which is I think what ultimately pushed my the stress in my pinky over the threshold) mapped to some IDE command, an application switcher, or some other vital function that I feel impaired without immediate access to.</p> <p>Anyway, it&#39;s clear how I screwed my finger up, but what exactly is happening physiologically here? What are the actual injuries that tend to occur with Emacs pinky?</p> <p>(I work freelance and was on my wife&#39;s insurance, which she just lost due to changing employment, so I&#39;m not going to be able to go to a doctor immediately. I was hoping that someone here who&#39;s been treated might have some information to share.)</p> <p>I read someone else talking about ulnar nerve entrapment, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what&#39;s happening in my case. I&#39;ll describe it as best I can to see if this matches how it feels for other people.</p> <p>The pain is located on the dorsal (top) side of the DIP (last) joint of my left little finger. I don&#39;t know how to describe the pain. It&#39;s focused right at the joint, but not exactly sharp. I suppose I would say sore, but it&#39;s not a diffuse pain. I almost want to describe it as feeling similar to overstretching a muscle that&#39;s already sore from exercise, but with an exaggerated pain component. </p> <p>I haven&#39;t noticed any numbness or tingling, though I am feeling sharp pin pricks occasionally. It&#39;s not tender to the touch, there&#39;s no noticeable swelling, and I can move it normally. I could probably even push through the current pain and work normally, but I realize that will almost certainly make the problem much worse.</p> <p>I also have some tension in my wrists and forearms, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s part of it, or if it&#39;s just an effect of extra tension produced by my anxiety over this.</p> <p>Anyway, does that sound similar to what others who have had Emacs pinky experienced? If so, what was actually injured in your case? Was there structural damage, or was it just chronic inflammation? And were you able to treat it?</p> <p>(Sorry. I realize I&#39;m asking a lot of questions.)</p> <p>In the meantime, I&#39;m trying to set up my old transcription pedal to use as modifier keys, and I&#39;ve ordered a low profile keyboard. I don&#39;t know if that will help.</p> <p>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks in advance for anything you might want to share.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nanocyte"> /u/nanocyte </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w34fc5/emacs_pinky_whats_physiologically_happening_and_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w34fc5/emacs_pinky_whats_physiologically_happening_and_a/">[comments]</a></span>
