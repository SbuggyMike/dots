Notice that the user claimed that it&#39;s not just the file on the cloud that got banned, but the local file also got locked. Despite WPS&#39;s repeated denials, many other users also reported similar incidents.</p> <p>I decided to post it here because many users in Linux community use WPS as an alternative to MS office. While this problem may or may not apply to non-Chinese or linux users, who most likely use a different version from what most Chinese users use on Windows, this is a reminder that you should avoid any Chinese software if possible unless it&#39;s a battle-tested open source software.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CartographerOne8375"> /u/CartographerOne8375 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vz1gse/allegedly_wps_encryptsdeletes_user_files_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vz1gse/allegedly_wps_encryptsdeletes_user_files_with/">[comments]</a></span>
