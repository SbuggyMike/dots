<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Chess amateur here. I am visiting NYC for the first time and would love to try my hand against the famous <em>chess hustlers.</em> I had a couple of questions and was hoping someone can lend some insight: </p> <ol> <li>Are the chess hustlers still located in Washington Park? I&#39;ve read a couple posts that they moved to Union Park? Are they at both? </li> <li>What time do these players usually congregate? </li> <li>What is the average price per game? 5$ or 1$? </li> <li>Should I bring my own pieces? </li> <li>Are there any unspoken rules I should know about? </li> <li>Is there any Covid-related safety precautions I should be aware of i.e. is shaking hands/fist bumping okay?</li> <li>Any advice/tips that a first-timer should know? </li> </ol> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/senpaibumboklaaat"> /u/senpaibumboklaaat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wesi1x/tldr_questions_about_chess_hustlers_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wesi1x/tldr_questions_about_chess_hustlers_in/">[comments]</a></span>
