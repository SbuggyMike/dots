<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After everyone pushing extremely hard for Wayland this week, I decided to stick with it on my fresh install. I&#39;ve steered clear of Wayland in the past due to the constant freezes and bugs I would always experience as well as the lack of support for VNC servers like RealVNC, but I decided to give it another chance. In between outright crashes, the desktop freezing for literal minutes, and seriously weird display issues, I was trying to search for a RealVNC alternative with no luck.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Is there really just 0 options for Wayland and GNOME even now? Is this just something I have to &quot;deal with&quot; for at least a decade or longer? Is this *really* the &quot;solution&quot; Wayland offers?</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Edit: I was able to get GNOME connections to work, but it has like 10 seconds of latency even when on the same network. I genuinely dont understand how so many people are happy with Wayland.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BUGMAN__"> /u/BUGMAN__ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13jsd2q/so_there_is_no_remote_desktop_options_for_wayland/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13jsd2q/so_there_is_no_remote_desktop_options_for_wayland/">[comments]</a></span>
