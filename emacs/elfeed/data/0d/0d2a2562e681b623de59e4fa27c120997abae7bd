<p>Chinese is the hardest language to learn according to normies who have
never tried to learn it.</p>
<p>In reality, Chinese is really easy. It has literally no complex
morphology: no tense, plurals, gender. It doesn't have irregular verbs
or nouns because it has no verb and noun endings whatsoever. It's
almost difficult to explain how easy Chinese is.</p>
<p>The only different thing is the writing system which is I hesitate to
say anachronistic. The Chinese character system is more structurally
similar to Sumerian cuneiform than to English morphophonemic writing.
That presents a unique hurdle, but one if properly tackled is not too
difficult and also edifying. It's important to realize in any case that
<em>learning a language and learning its writing system are two separate
things</em>.</p>
<p>Knowing this is important for mastering or even beginning Chinese.</p>
<h2 id="these-are-the-best-chinese-books">These are the best Chinese Books</h2>
<p>The Yale series by John DeFrancis is not just the absolute best for
learning Chinese, but they are an eternal exemplar of basically the best
you can do for any language. The books all have generic names and
they're linked below with audio. The books are <strong>massive</strong>. Even if you
just get &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot; and &quot;Beginning Chinese Reader, Part 1,&quot;
you'll know around 4 semesters worth of Chinese compared to your
average university course. They have free audio too. Remember that if
you get nervous about their price tags, which might be as high as $50.
These books are severely worth it though.</p>
<p>There are actually two parallel book series in the DeFrancis/Yale
series: the <a href="#green">green books</a>, which cover the spoken language (in
Romanization) and the <a href="#red">red books</a> (the readers) that cover
characters. It might sound strange to cover the language itself and the
characters separately, but it is <em>massively</em> superior.</p>

<p>The great thing about the main series is that <em>they come with many, many
exercises and drills</em> which are actually good for individual use. Books
that expect you to read something once and internalize it are
irreparable.</p>
<p>Links are to the official Yale site. Probably better to buy on eBay or
something though. Worth the money even when they are expensive.</p>

<p>You can get .pdfs of all these books on Library Genesis. I have physical
copies, except some an ex-girlfriend borrowed and never gave back. If
you read this, you better send them back!</p>
<p>Note that I've also linked audio that was recorded for these books,
which is great. They used to cost a lot too, but now they're free!</p>
<h3 id="red">The Red Books (for characters)</h3>

<p>The reason the language in transliteration and the characters are in two
books is because learning them is really two different processes. The
green books are more typical language learning books. The red
books/readers are different.</p>
<p>Every chapter, they teach you 10 characters, but with those 10
characters, you might learn to combine them into 50 new words based on
them. The pacing here is for only learning the essential and most used
characters as simply as possible as you advance. The readers do not
explain grammar and expect you to be advancing in the green books to
understand grammatical things.</p>

<h3 id="the-blue-books">The Blue Books?</h3>
<p>I won't link them because they sort of the defeat the point, and I
don't have them, but there is also a blue series which is just the
green series but with the language in characters. I think it's intended
more for classes that can't do the DeFrancis method due to bureaucratic
constraints. If it has the exercises of the green books, that's good
and all, but really the value of the system is the fact that when you do
the spoken language in the green books, you don't have to worry about
unknown characters and when you do the characters in the red book,
that's all you need to pay attention to.</p>
<p>I'm not dismissing the blue books, because the quality of the
Yale/DeFrancis series is still light-years ahead of all other series,
but I'd stick with the classics here.</p>
<h2 id="notes-about-chinese">Notes about Chinese</h2>
<h3 id="the-tone-cope">The tone cope</h3>
<p>I remember having normalfriends in my Chinese class (which was a waste
of time, just get the DeFrancis books) who would say that Chinese
wasn't too hard &quot;except for the tones.&quot; Mandarin Chinese has four
tones that distinguish words. If you've sat through your first day in
Chinese class or even seen a YouTube video on Chinese, you know this.</p>
<p>Normies see this alien concept of having tones and they turn their
brains off. There were kids in my class who said they'd &quot;just not
learn&quot; the tones. Which is sort of like saying you're going to learn
English, but not the vowels &quot;because they're too hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Actually around half of the world's languages have tones. They are not
bizarre or highly &quot;marked&quot; in an objective sense. They are much more
common that the &quot;th&quot; sound in English. You can bear it.</p>
