I updated my brew packages yesterday, thereby inadvertently updating Emacs to version 28, which proved incompatible with my v26 configuration.
</p>

<p>
Emacs started up in an unusable state, with multiple errors.
</p>

<p>
This brought my workflow to a grinding halt.  I should really have a backup Textmind instance for such situations.  (Maybe I do somewhere.)
</p>

<p>
I googled how to downgrade the package in brew, but that appeared needlessly complicated.  Brew did not have alternative versions of Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Instead I downloaded Emacs 26.3 from <a href="https://emacsformacosx.com/builds/all">Emacs for Macos X</a>.  I installed it as Emacs 3 (and Emacs 27 as Emacs 2).
</p>

<p>
I ran Emacs 3, and everything worked fine.  Now I can upgrade my configuration at my leisure, and my workflow is uninterrupted.
</p>

<p>
My googling didn't highlight this easy answer, causing me to waste time doing questionable things at the Terminal.
</p>

<p>
I have a complicated setup with Chemacs profiles etc, and it somewhat surprised me when everything just worked.  That's why I use MacOS.

Best practices are good, but fast food is forever!
