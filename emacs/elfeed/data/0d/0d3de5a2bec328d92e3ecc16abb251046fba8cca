The US is suing to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/01/merger-antitrust-penguin-random-house-simon-schuster">block the merger</a> of two of the five giant US
publishing companies.

This demonstrates the weakness of our antitrust laws.  For two such
large companies to merge should be a crime, so that blocking the
merger requires no lawsuit.  We should not have let them get down to
less than 20.
