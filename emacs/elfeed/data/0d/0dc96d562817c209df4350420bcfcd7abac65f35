<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would like to have a file <code>posts.org</code> and inside of it I would have multiple &quot;posts&quot; such as:</p> <pre><code>* A post Some content * Another post some other content </code></pre> <p>The default result of <code>org-publish-all</code> is to build a single <code>posts.html</code>. Is there a way to split up top-level headings into their own html pages?</p> <p>One thought I had was to write an elisp function that does this prior to the publishing function being called, but I&#39;d rather avoid that solution as it&#39;s another step in the build process.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ExistentialTowel"> /u/ExistentialTowel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfb0k4/splitting_a_tree_into_multiple_pages_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfb0k4/splitting_a_tree_into_multiple_pages_on/">[comments]</a></span>
