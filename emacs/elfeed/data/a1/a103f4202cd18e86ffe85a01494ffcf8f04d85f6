<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The two symphonies of Liszt don&#39;t seem to get much attention, whether through discussion, recordings or onstage performance. The lack of onstage performance I thought might have been due to their length, but the relative paucity of recordings makes me wonder whether they&#39;re just not that good?</p> <p>I really like the Faust Symphony, but only the Bernstein/BSO and Solti/CSO recordings come to mind. The Dante Symphony is a little less good (IMO) and when I searched for CD recordings (I usually avoid streaming), the only recording I could find was Jesus Lopez-Cobos (a conductor with whom I&#39;m unfamiliar) with Lâ€™Orchestre de la Suisse Romande on Decca.</p> <p>Would like to hear thoughts on these (somewhat?) neglected works!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dangerous-Hour6062"> /u/Dangerous-Hour6062 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wiwwto/hardly_discussed_the_symphonies_of_liszt/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wiwwto/hardly_discussed_the_symphonies_of_liszt/">[comments]</a></span>
