<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Now that Firefox 103.0 has just been released, people are everywhere asking when it will be coming to their distribution.</p> <p>In Arch it already is, but I always wonder how they do things.</p> <p>In my case I have tried other distributions, like Tumbleweed, Fedora or LMDE, and I have always found more problems in those distributions than in Arch.</p> <p>Distributions that, in theory, should be more stable, since they do not publish updates until their programs are well tested, so I wonder how they do things in Arch so that, in my case, I hardly get problems with the latest versions of the programs, while in the others always appears something (Firefox....Plasma....Dolphin ...) that usually gives some other program.</p> <p>It is true that I like to keep my system with very few packages installed and I hardly use anything from AUR but, for example, no matter how minimalist I make the installation of Tumbleweed (as its installer allows it) I always end up having problems, usually small problems, it is true, but they do not appear in Arch.</p> <p>Does anyone else usually have less problems with Arch packages, even if they are more up to date than the other distributions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jbellas"> /u/jbellas </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbahbx/arch_linux_updates/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbahbx/arch_linux_updates/">[comments]</a></span>
