<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to reinstall my system the same way I installed it the first time, but this time with disk encryption. I&#39;ve backed up all my data onto an external drive, so you don&#39;t have to worry about that. I don&#39;t exactly know how I can do this though, I think I have to modify the installation script in some way but I don&#39;t know how (as in idk what to modify). If anybody could please help, thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Amber___yo"> /u/Amber___yo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6dpwn/how_can_i_enable_full_disk_encryption_while_using/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6dpwn/how_can_i_enable_full_disk_encryption_while_using/">[comments]</a></span>
