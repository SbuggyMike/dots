<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Post <code>pacman -Syyu</code> my machine now hangs during boot.<br/> With &quot;quiet&quot; removed from the kernel params, the last message I see is:<br/> <code>[ OK ] Mounted Temporary Directory /tmp.</code></p> <p>No other virtual screens are available. However, I can ssh into it.</p> <p>I do not normally run a display manager (<code>startx</code> all the way); so I don&#39;t think X has been invoked yet.</p> <p>Is there a way from the ssh session to figure out which is the next command after mounting /tmp? (presumably that&#39;s what&#39;s hanging)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ericxb"> /u/ericxb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wh24ig/arch_hanging_during_boot/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wh24ig/arch_hanging_during_boot/">[comments]</a></span>
