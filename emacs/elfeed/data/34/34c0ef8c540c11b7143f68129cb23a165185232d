<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have this problem for some time now and seems that it happens independent from which DE/WM I use. I use fluxbox at this time but this happens also with xfce and cinnamon which I&#39;ve try. I don&#39;t have a DM and start via xinit. I&#39;ve found some similar threads In archlinux&#39;s forum and I checked and correct .xinitrc as suggested there, but this didn&#39;t solve the problem. When fluxbox starts(which also have some delay) conky and a pyqt5 application I have in autstart start normally. If I run wezterm it starts without delay also, but firefox, nemo, lutris which I usually run need about 30~40 seconds to start. After this first start, there is no delay if I run them again though. Also if I logout from fluxbox and re-login, then those apps start faster. Any ideas how to fix this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dancaer69"> /u/dancaer69 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8ifcg/slow_first_start_of_gtk_applications/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8ifcg/slow_first_start_of_gtk_applications/">[comments]</a></span>
