Costa Rica sets an example of successfully reversing deforestation.
Since around 1990, most of the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/21/costa-rica-uk-land">lost forests have grown back</a>.
<p>
The basic idea was to pay the owner of a formerly forested area just a
little more than the pittance that could be made from inefficient
raising of cattle, for letting forest grow there.

I wonder if this method can be adapted to the Brazilian Amazon.
The situation is not the same.
