<p>Latin was the first language I learned and has probably been the most
useful. Here I'll talk about some of the things it's gotten me and
some recommendations for how to learn it well.</p>
<h2 id="what-ive-gotten-out-of-learning-latin">What I've gotten out of learning Latin</h2>
<h3 id="you-get-multiple-languages-for-one">You get multiple languages for one.</h3>
<p>Latin, as you probably know is the ancestor of Italian, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Romanian, etc. Once you know Latin, it is quite literally
downhill learning any of these. In college, I decided to take Spanish
for a degree specialization (I was doing an international business thing
and required a foreign language). Merely based on my knowledge of Latin,
I just tested into fifth-level Spanish and figured it out from there. I
don't even remember learning Spanish, but I can speak it and still do
every once in a while.</p>
<p>In grad school I took classes taught in Spanish and French. I can
basically read all Romance languages. I even read Rhaeto-Romance poetry
for fun (the languages of Switzerland). All of this is nearly free stuff
when you learn Latin.</p>
<h3 id="latin-will-unironically-red-pill-you-on-many-subjects">Latin will unironically red-pill you on many subjects.</h3>
<p>Looking to other cultures in the world might change your view of things
in some superficial way, but looking into the past will revolutionize
how you see it. A recurring point I make in many contexts is that <strong>the
past is literally an alien civilization</strong>. Most of what people pretend
they know about it is repeatedly cited modern rumors about it. Seeing it
in its own words is very different.</p>
<p>It's insane the amount of writing done in Latin in the medieval period
and antiquity, so much of which isn't even on the mind of translators.
A lot of historians just cite modern historians. Theologians cite modern
theologians. Scientists cite modern scientists. Once you crack open a
traditional book on any of these subjects you realize the provinciality
and oblviousness of modern &quot;frameworks.&quot;</p>
<p>In generative linguistics, people who have never read anything written
before 1950 pat themselves on the back for all the &quot;problems&quot; they've
solved not knowing they are only retreading paths long established by
Stoics, Modistae and early Indo-Europeanists. There are a lot of
theologians and philosophers who are trapped in modern citation circles
because they don't have the power of Latin that can bring them in touch
directly with Aquinas or Augustine or other philosophers of the early
periods.</p>
<p>Knowing Latin is like an academic superpower and supposed intellectuals
will fear you. Latin used to be the bare minimum of a respectable
intellectual... actually... you know what, it still is. Now is your
chance to have an actual one up over more pompous people whose only
function is writing lit reviews with a disability to read original
sources. Being privy to an original and long-neglected source will be a
continuous content mill which will unironically be the envy of others in
academia.</p>
<h3 id="knowing-latin-is-better-academically-than-an-undergraduate-degree-in-linguistics">Knowing Latin is better academically than an undergraduate degree in linguistics.</h3>
<p>The process of learning Latin and the lore around you will equip you
with all the terminology and principles to make you superior to someone
who just studies &quot;linguistics&quot; without any actual application. I
really mean this. When I was a grad student in linguistics, all the
brightest undergrads had one thing in common: Latin. I actually came to
judge people based on how they first got interested in linguistics. The
smartest ones always started with Latin, the biggest plebs always
started because they liked some Steven Pinker book (sorry Pinkucks!
Those are the honest facts!)</p>

<h3 id="what-i-used">What I used</h3>
<p>When I learned Latin, all I had was a copy of <a href="https://www.textkit.com/learn/ID/113/author_id/41/">this
book</a>: Collar &amp;
Daniell's <em>Beginner's Latin Book</em>. The truth is that most <em>old</em> Latin
books are good (old being at least 70 to 100 years old). After language
learning became commercialized, it all became dismissable. You can see a
list of downloadable Latin textbooks and other materials here
<a href="https://www.textkit.com/latin_grammar.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>The only other source I used in the past to learn and read Latin in a
biglottic Latin/Greek New Testament (i.e. Greek on the left and Latin on
the right). This is probably actually the single most significant book I
own, now that I think about it. I learned Greek from it too and I've
had it for around 15 years now.</p>
<h3 id="lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata">Lingua Latina per se Illustrata</h3>
<p>Although I didn't know about until later, there is another very unique
and excellently made Latin series called <em>Lingua Latina per se
Illustrata</em> &quot;The Latin Language Illustrated by Itself&quot; by <a href="https://lingualatina.dk/wp/">Hans
Orberg</a>. You can see an English publisher
<a href="https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series">here</a>,
but you can also find them on eBay or pdfs on Library Genesis or Pirate
Bay (along with audio for the books).</p>
<p><em>LLPSI</em> is unique and really stands out. <strong>The entire book, including
explanations is in Latin.</strong> Latin words and grammatical concepts are
explained by illustration and example. This sounds absurd frankly: how
are you supposed to learn a language from a book written in that
language? But the design is so perfect that it works.</p>
<p>I recommend to get <em>LLPSI</em> <em>and</em> some classical grammar primer like
<a href="https://www.textkit.com/learn/ID/113/author_id/41/">Collar &amp;
Daniell's</a> because
I think especially for newbs, it might be necessary to have explicit
instruction about grammar points in English.</p>
<h2 id="read-this">Read this</h2>
<p><a href="https://wcdrutgers.net/Latin.htm">Read this article: &quot;Latin by the Dowling
Method.&quot;</a> It's back from the early
internet and its recommendations have stood the test of time and I agree
with them.</p>
<h2 id="latin-links">Latin links</h2>
<p>You may've known about these already, but they're worth noting.</p>
