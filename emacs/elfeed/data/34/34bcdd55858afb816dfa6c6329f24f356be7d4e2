<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an HP Envy 4500 MFP that I installed without any problems through CUPS.</p> <p>When I want to print something it does it perfectly, but when I want to scan it asks me for a password, giving me a message that &quot;An application is trying to perform an action that requires privileges. Authentication is required to perform this action&quot;.</p> <p>If I click on Details I get: Action: Manage system services or other units ID: org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage.units</p> <p>I tried to add my user to the scanner group: usermod -a -G scanner juan</p> <p>I still get the message, but if I ignore it, with the esc key, I can scan normally without having to enter the password.</p> <p>Does anyone know why it asks me for a password, even though it doesn&#39;t seem to need it, and how can I stop it from getting that message? I&#39;m in Plasma KDE and I try to scan with SimpleScan.</p> <p>Thank you very much.
