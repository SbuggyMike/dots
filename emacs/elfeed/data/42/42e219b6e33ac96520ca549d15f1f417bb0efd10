<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using emacs for many years, but I still barely understand it.<br/> So I apologize in advance if this question is premised on poor understandings of emacs / LSP.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Anyway, I&#39;ve set it up as a web development environment. I&#39;ve managed to get LSP working for js/jsx.</p> <p>LSP provides autocomplete functionality: once I start typing out a js keyword, LSP gives me completion candidates. Things look like this:</p> <p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/4heaW4J.png">https://i.imgur.com/4heaW4J.png</a></p> <p>What you can see *beneath* the list of LSP auto-completion candidates is a list of candidates produced by auto-complete-mode. </p> <p>So if I hit &#39;tab&#39;, I get completion for the auto-complete-mode candidate. Not the currently-selected LSP candidate. </p> <p>This is frustrating as hell. I can work around it manually, but that adds a cognitive tax that I&#39;d rather live without. </p> <p>Now, I could disable auto-complete-mode. But then I&#39;d lose the capacity to get auto-completion on other strings. </p> <p>Is there a way to get auto-complete-mode to stand down if a candidate list from LSP is being presented?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/imacarpet"> /u/imacarpet </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13ir4fh/how_do_i_stop_autocomplete_mode_from_stomping_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13ir4fh/how_do_i_stop_autocomplete_mode_from_stomping_on/">[comments]</a></span>
