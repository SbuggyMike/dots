<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, </p> <p>I know there is a new feature in Emacs (I think since 29) that you could enable to make Emacs act more like other modern Desktop programs, where you could scroll with the mouse wheel and the view would change, but the position of the point remains where it is. When the point is then moved to (via arrow key for example) the view would jump back to the point. </p> <p>I know I read this somewhere, but I just can not find it. Someone know what I mean?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Schievel1"> /u/Schievel1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138hgab/emacs_and_keeping_the_point_position_when_mouse/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138hgab/emacs_and_keeping_the_point_position_when_mouse/">[comments]</a></span>
