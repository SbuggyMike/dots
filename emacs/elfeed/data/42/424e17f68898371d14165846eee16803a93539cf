<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few days ago I asked this question:</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wa73du/i_am_unable_to_remap_m1_or_m2_to_my_shortcuts_in/"><strong>https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wa73du/i_am_unable_to_remap_m1_or_m2_to_my_shortcuts_in/</strong></a></p> <p>This question has been seen 1700 times and has a 100% upvote rate as you can see here: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pAdhWeQ.png">https://i.imgur.com/pAdhWeQ.png</a> , yet there is not a single answer (outside of my 1 comment asking people what do they need more to be able to help).</p> <p>My question to you is, what should I formulate differently, or what other information should I bring in so the question would attract at least 1 answer.</p> <p>Or, should I put more effort into titles? Do Emacs enthusiasts appreciate a witty titles like &quot;A meta question about meta keys question&quot; more than &quot;Why doesn&#39;t my question about meta keys rebinding get any answers?&quot; Do the feel that responding/helping/interacting with a person who puts effort into titles will be more enjoyable, worth spending their time than talking to somebody whose titles are &quot;ordinary&quot;?</p> <p>I shared this question on Spacemacs subredit as well, but only 2 guys who are even less experienced than me tried to help, but as I said, they didn&#39;t have any deep knowledge about Emacs at all, they were beginners as one of them admitted.</p> <p>Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/East_Staff3288"> /u/East_Staff3288 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wdad2v/a_meta_question_about_meta_keys_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wdad2v/a_meta_question_about_meta_keys_question/">[comments]</a></span>
