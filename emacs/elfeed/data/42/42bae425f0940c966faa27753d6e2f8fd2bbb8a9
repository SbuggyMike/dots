<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking to create a tor relay that will run 24/7 on an old laptop. It&#39;ll be a very miminal install, will only have the absolute minimum number of packages to successfully run a tor middle relay. I&#39;m aware of the risks of automatically updating all the packages in arch, but I want my tor package to be updated on a regular basis, as soon as they&#39;re released, at the very least.</p> <p>Is my only choice creating a shell script that executes once in a while or is there a more refined option?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IcyEvening2484"> /u/IcyEvening2484 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w20rk5/does_pacman_have_an_autoupdate_feature/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w20rk5/does_pacman_have_an_autoupdate_feature/">[comments]</a></span>
