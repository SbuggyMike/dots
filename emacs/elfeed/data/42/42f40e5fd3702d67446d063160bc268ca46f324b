<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today&#39;s April 27th, exactly one year since I installed the current system I&#39;m using. I remember this date because it&#39;s also my birthday! This was my first ever rolling release, it feels awesome hitting this &quot;milestone&quot;. (I&#39;m also 1 year away from the 3 decade life milestone, boy how time flies) Aside from having to learn more about how grub works this past August, I have not had one single issue, and it&#39;s been a pleasure being living proof that the &quot;Arch breaks on its own&quot; quip is just a myth. I use the GNOME desktop, I have merely 734 packages installed, I don&#39;t have use for the AUR and I update once a week on Friday after work. Everything handled with <code>yay</code>.</p> <p>With this, I&#39;m wondering how I did overtime. I&#39;ve grown a habit of checking for journal errors after big updates by running the first 2 commands listed on the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/system_maintenance">Arch System maintenance</a> page. The only &quot;error&quot; I&#39;ve <em>ever</em> seen on this system since initial setup is the infamous <code>Failed to start Application launched by gnome-session-binary</code> but that isn&#39;t a real error more just a warning/message. And, when pacman tells me there&#39;s a pacnew, I edit it if required. So easy that isn&#39;t even really worth mentioning honestly. I&#39;ve never had to deal with the stress of downgrading a package or working around dependency issues, everything on Arch simply works and all I do is type <code>yay</code> read the text and press enter a few times.</p> <p>Is there anything else beyond potential upstream update issues that can snowball on a rolling/Arch system? For example, package cache? I heard it does not get deleted automatically, for all I know it could be huge. I&#39;ve also heard somewhere before that it&#39;s a good idea to reinstall <code>archlinux-keyring</code> here and there, is there any credence to that? Or is it really this easy to maintain a rolling system compared to popular belief? I don&#39;t see anything a regular user should have to do besides simply be aware and address problems when (if?!?!) they pop up. I have yet to experience any one year in however.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/waiting4ugordon"> /u/waiting4ugordon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1318de5/1_year_anniversary_longterm_maintenance_tips/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1318de5/1_year_anniversary_longterm_maintenance_tips/">[comments]</a></span>
