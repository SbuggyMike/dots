<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have like micro stutter when using the desktop, opening windows, browsing my network servers or the web. It&#39;s not slow, but it is a little bit off. I&#39;ve tried manually trimming my nvme drives, I&#39;ve read different performance related posts on the wiki but nothing solves it. </p> <p>It feels like an harddrive I/O issue but i cant seem to find whats wrong. </p> <p>Laptop Hardware Acer Predator Triton 500 Cpu: 9750H Ram: 16gb 3200mhz Nvme: Samsung 970 Pro Plus 500gb + Samsung 970 Pro Plus 1tb Gpu: Integrated Intel + Nvidia 2060 Mobile</p> <p>Last time i had this issue (about 9months ago) i gave up in the end and installed Windows and used it for a few hours and realized why i switched to linux and when reinstalling arch again everything worked again. So what am i missing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/m0ddas"> /u/m0ddas </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1336ydi/random_micro_performance_issues/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1336ydi/random_micro_performance_issues/">[comments]</a></span>
