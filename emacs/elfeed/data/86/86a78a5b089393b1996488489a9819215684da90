<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think nearly everyone except Canonical agrees that Flatpak is better in just about every way compared to Snap: it’s a lot faster, integrates better with the system (especially theming), and it has more 3rd party support now.</p> <p>But Flatpak, by design, cannot replace the system package manager; it is intended to run GUI apps in a self-contained way. You can’t install a kernel, driver, or desktop environment in Flatpak. This leads to the next problem: apt is antiquated. The biggest issue is that unlike dnf or eopkg, there is no one liner to rollback an apt transaction. This feature, alone, could save users a lot of pain, e.g. when an LTT style meltdown occurs. Nor it would be very hard to implement. Another improvement that could be made is to make apt <code>update</code> before <code>upgrade</code> (not an issue on dnf).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alex_Strgzr"> /u/Alex_Strgzr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wicpe7/canonical_should_ditch_snap_embrace_flatpak_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wicpe7/canonical_should_ditch_snap_embrace_flatpak_and/">[comments]</a></span>
