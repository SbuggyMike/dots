<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>I&#39;ve written a new package to track down the correct Python executables from the various virtualenvs that you might create for your Python projects.</p> <p>In short, the motivation for this package is that modern Python projects typically rely on a bunch of linters and formatters, and they can all be installed in different virtualenvs. This package will find those installed in <code>pre-commit</code>, then <code>poetry</code>, and then finally whatever is on your <code>exec-path</code>, and then assign the absolute paths to many of the <a href="https://github.com/wyuenho/emacs-pet#supported-emacs-packages">supported Emacs package</a> variables. The full list of supported virtualenv tools is <a href="https://github.com/wyuenho/emacs-pet#supported-python-virtual-environment-tools">here</a>.</p> <p>This package is in early preview, but it&#39;s perfectly usable for most situations by my estimate. If you run into any problems, please don&#39;t hesitate to file an issue on the repo.</p> <p>Also, if you have any idea about writing tests for this package without having me creating all kinds of a fixtures or mocking dozens of things, please let me know! </p> <p><a href="https://github.com/wyuenho/emacs-pet">https://github.com/wyuenho/emacs-pet</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wyuenho"> /u/wyuenho </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wje61l/preview_python_executable_tracker_for_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wje61l/preview_python_executable_tracker_for_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
