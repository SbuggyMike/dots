<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy. I&#39;m completely new to Emacs. Just loaded it up for the first time on Ubuntu Studio 22.04 and the UI is way to small to see anything (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/dIokUxG">see this screenshot</a>).</p> <p>I looked for solutions and everyone says to Ctrl + Scroll Wheel, and that doesn&#39;t do it. It only zooms the editor. The UI / Window stuff itself says small.</p> <p>I tried installing the Spacemacs config to see if it would fix it, but it didn&#39;t.</p> <p>Any ideas on how to fix this?</p> <p>edit: The award goes to <a href="/u/Faerryn">u/Faerryn</a> for fixing it. Thanks to everyone else for the suggestions, but thankfully I don&#39;t have to try them. I&#39;ve added the solution here for easy finding:</p> <ol> <li>Open <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code></li> <li>Add <code>(set-face-attribute &#39;default nil :family &quot;FONT HERE&quot; :height 120)</code> to the file.</li> <li>Replace <code>&quot;FONT HERE&quot;</code> with your desired font.</li> <li>Save the file.</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tristan401"> /u/Tristan401 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w0zy1v/emacs_ui_text_is_too_small_cant_see_anything/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w0zy1v/emacs_ui_text_is_too_small_cant_see_anything/">[comments]</a></span>
