<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/28/uk-readers-may-lose-access-to-wikipedia-amid-online-safety-bill-requirements">Wikipedia warns</a>
that the UK's proposed web censorship and age
verification requirements would cut off access to Wikipedia in the UK.

Bravo to Wikipedia for refusing to compromise with censorship and
tracking.  However Ms Crompton-Reid made a grave conceptual error by
including Wikipedia in the category of businesses &mdash; "players" in a "market".
<p>
Wikipedia's virtue, what makes it morally important despite its
imperfections, is precisely that it is <em>not</em>
a business.  It does <em>not</em> operate in a "market",
and it has a commitment to a goal beyond its own success.
<p>
The cynicism of "players" may resonate with a general vague
condemnation of business, which to some extent business in general
deserves; but it also tends to silence moral discussion about any
business's acts or practices.  Even to raise the question of whether a
certain business, or a certain line of business, treats people
unjustly is more difficult with the "players" metaphor
sneering at it.
