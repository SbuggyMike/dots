<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Emacs recently in the last two years gained tab support. I use tab-bar-mode and emacs 28.1, and I want to be able save this current layout to a file so I can reload it when opening emacsclient again. </p> <p>If I have tabs A, B and C open in that order, I want to open them again in that order after closing emacsclient. The tabs should also still open the same buffers that were open in them before. </p> <p>My understanding is that desktop-mode can do this, but <code>(desktop-save-mode)</code> in my .emacs config only reloads buffers and doesn&#39;t open the last used buffer in the current window. </p> <p>How do I save tab-bar-mode layout in emacs? </p> <p>Edit: I should also specify I use emacs exclusively in terminal mode for a few reasons that would take too long to explain</p> <p>Edit 2: clarification </p> <p>Edit 3: I found that it DOES work with GUI emacs, but not terminal emacs. Is there any workaround or plugin which will work? </p> <p><a href="https://reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/dcryg1/tab_support_landed_in_emacs_master/f2awyzh?context=3">https://reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/dcryg1/tab_support_landed_in_emacs_master/f2awyzh?context=3</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CyanKing64"> /u/CyanKing64 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb6c4e/how_to_save_tab_layout_on_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb6c4e/how_to_save_tab_layout_on_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
