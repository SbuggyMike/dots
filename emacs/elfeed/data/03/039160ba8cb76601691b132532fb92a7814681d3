<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‘ve chosen Arch because I wanted to learn more about Operation Systems in general and having too many driver issues on Windows (Usually wifi driver issues, screen driver issues, etc.) and was tired out if it now, so I‘ve decided to just switch to Linux instead for obvious reasons and also liked it on my old laptop which I also had lots of driver issues on Windows which seemed to disappear once I switched to Manjaro</p> <p>One of my friend has a similar laptop model as mine and also had lots of driver issues on Windows which also have seemed to disappear once he switched to Arch</p> <p>I am unable to use any other distro really since my USB stick has a maximum size of 1,5gb so arch is the best choice i think</p> <p>Sorry for my terrible English, it’s not my mother tongue so you probably might misunderstand something I have said, my apologize</p> <p>But I would gladly appreciate any help!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/uShinnosuke"> /u/uShinnosuke </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wjmzxs/failed_to_start_load_kernel_modules_after/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wjmzxs/failed_to_start_load_kernel_modules_after/">[comments]</a></span>
