<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am an avid anki user who has a large collection of cards in anki. I&#39;ve looked into org drill but I don&#39;t want to use it as I&#39;d like to stick with anki for spaced repitition. But oftentimes, I&#39;ll be in emacs and would like to search my anki collection. I also know about anki-editor to export org mode &quot;cards&quot; to anki, which in the future can work to search the cards I created in org, but what I&#39;d really like to be able to search my current anki collection from emacs to see if a fact exists in one of my anki decks.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Is this possible? I&#39;ve seen anki2org package that can convert anki cards to org mode, and maybe this could work but I&#39;d like to have org mode be able to just read my .apkg files without having to constantly convert it manually.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nick91700"> /u/nick91700 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wenvic/how_to_view_anki_card_content_in_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wenvic/how_to_view_anki_card_content_in_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
