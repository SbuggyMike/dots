<p>&#8216;A new Cabinet Office policy has recently been published which provides guidance on the use of instant messaging technologies, such as WhatsApp, by government officials. The policy discourages the use of non-corporate communications channels (&#8220;NCCCs&#8221;), particularly when these platforms are accessed on personal devices. The new policy is a welcome development in the regulation of &#8220;government by WhatsApp,&#8221; and demonstrates better practice with respect to the public law duties which are applicable in this context, namely, the Public Records Act 1958, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the common law duty of candour.&#8217;</p>
