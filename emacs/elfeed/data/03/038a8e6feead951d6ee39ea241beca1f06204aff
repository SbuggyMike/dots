Why Bannon's defiance of a subpoena to testify in Congress goes <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/opinions/conviction-contempt-steve-bannon-eisen-aftergut/index.html">hand in hand
with insurrection</a>.
<p>
Bannon claimed that the wrecker still has the "executive privilege" to
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/politics/steve-bannon-contempt-of-congress-january-6-verdict/index.html">forbid Bannon from testifying</a>, even though the wrecker no longer holds
an executive office.  This could be the basis of an appeal.

It seems pretty obvious to me that ex-officials must not have any
power to block testimony about what they did while in office.
