<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, </p> <p>On my linux journey, I learn as things break. Today I upgraded to find that alsa-lib 1.2.7.2-1 , and its adjacent packages, stopped the functioning and registering of my audio interface (motu m2). Simple fix is to downgrade all of the associated packages and add them to PkgIgnore. Although I would like to learn what is the best practice when you notice that your common hardware is incompatible with common software. Is it my duty to make a comment under issues in <a href="https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib">https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib</a> ? Or is there more digging I can do to learn whether it truly is the software or something else?</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Thank you in advance :))</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooPineapples9121"> /u/SnooPineapples9121 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vy03r9/what_to_do_when_a_package_doesnt_work_with_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vy03r9/what_to_do_when_a_package_doesnt_work_with_your/">[comments]</a></span>
