Senate Democrats are likely to fail to fill all the vacancies in
federal courts by the end of this year.  If they lose control
of the senate, those vacancies will go unfilled until 2024
and <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/06/29/lunacy-democrats-risk-running-out-time-confirm-federal-judges">might be filled by Republicans instead</a>.

Why do they not eliminate the rule that allows individual senators to
block these appointments?  The Republicans did.  Could it be that
Manchin or Sinema is sabotaging this?
