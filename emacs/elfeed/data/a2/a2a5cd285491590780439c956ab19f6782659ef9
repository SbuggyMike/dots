<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys i&#39;m reaching out to you for some last help.<br/> I&#39;m mostly accessing my work laptop through xrdp, so i dont have to swap all the cables every morning.<br/> The only issue i&#39;m having is that the gnome-keyring does not appear to properly function.<br/> If i try to open seahorse after logging in, it takes a long to open up and doesnt show the login part which is used by eg. MySQL Workbench or intellij idea in order to save passwords. </p> <p>I&#39;m using awesomewm and when logging in on the physical laptop it all works just fine<br/> I have put a few files, i believe are relevant for this in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/Yahatix/d2f95116f766b9b077bfa29d2c4acc77">gist</a> (.xinitrc startwm.sh pam.d/xrdp-sesman pam.d/system-auth journalctl)</p> <p>Relevant package versions:<br/> xrdp: 0.19-2<br/> xorgxrdp-nvidia: 0.2.18-2<br/> gnome-keyring: 1:43.1-1<br/> seahorse: 1:42.0-1<br/> awesome: 4.3-3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Yahatix"> /u/Yahatix </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg8hfh/seahorse_not_showing_login_with_xrdp_gnomekeyring/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg8hfh/seahorse_not_showing_login_with_xrdp_gnomekeyring/">[comments]</a></span>
