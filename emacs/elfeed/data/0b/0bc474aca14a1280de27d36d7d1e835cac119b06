<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Two weeks ago, there was a reddit post on <a href="/r/chess">r/chess</a> about an obscure International Master who had an inactive Youtube channel. He hadn&#39;t created any new content in 11 months. In his Youtube-posting days he reached very little success (averaging 20 views per video and a minimal amount of subscribers) even though he had been working seemingly relentlessly on them and had ended up creating more than 60 instructive videos. </p> <p>After the aforementioned post (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w65027/im_giorgi_sibashvili_made_a_youtube_channel_last/">https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w65027/im_giorgi_sibashvili_made_a_youtube_channel_last/</a>) everything changed. That post gathered nearly 1000 upvotes and brought considerable attention to his channel. The reddit community seems to have given him the boost that he needed to try again. And boy did it work! In one of his latest videos, he managed to get more than 2K views and +600 likes! </p> <p>None of that would have been possible without the Reddit community. It shows how powerful a simple post can be.</p> <p>I&#39;m glad that a lesser known Youtuber is getting a bit of attention, and I daresay his content is of better quality than many famous channels. I believe in the power of our community and it will be a success for the chess world if an outsider can break through those tough barriers.</p> <p>Here is the man, the myth, the legend! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IMGiorgiSibashvili">https://www.youtube.com/c/IMGiorgiSibashvili</a> </p> <p>Let&#39;s make miracles happen once more!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/average_bad_redditor"> /u/average_bad_redditor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/whym9d/the_power_of_the_reddit_community/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/whym9d/the_power_of_the_reddit_community/">[comments]</a></span>
