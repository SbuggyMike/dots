<p>Firstly, once you reach basic competency in Linux, different
distributions don't matter. A lot of newbies analyze distros based on
what they look like when you install them, often not realizing that
it's a pretty simple affair not just to change superficial things like
your theme and setup, but entire desktop environments. <strong>Basically all
distro reviews online are wastes of time for people who know what
they're doing.</strong> When I came to YouTube, all Linux YouTube was was
people constantly installing distro after distro in a virtual machine
and critiquing minutiae. It was a bleak and boring world. One of my
first and greatest achievements on YouTube was making this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zpgQpdy_fI">How
to choose a Linux distro: Stop
Thinking!</a>, which went
semi-viral and sort of put a damper on distro reviews. Either way, I'll
say what I think about different distro minutiae here.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-matter">Things that matter</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free software.</strong> If you are switching to Linux, there is no point
of you just using junk proprietary spyware &quot;apps&quot; that you used on
Windows. Any distribution that advertises proprietary software as a
feature should be viewed as suspect. You can always <em>install</em>
proprietary software if there is some particular need (usually the
only &quot;need&quot; is a lack of knowledge of free software that is more
extensible and performs the same tasks and more).</li>
<li><strong>Up-to-date software.</strong> This matters because if you want to install
a program, you're often going to need recent
libraries/depencencies. This is especially important if you want to
use software in active development: say software for video-game
compatibility on Linux.</li>
<li><strong>No gimmicky additions.</strong> Probably the worst thing you can do is
install a distribution that puts a giant wall between you and the
system itself. One of the biggest advantages of using Linux is the
ability to understand what's going on on your computer and optimize
it. If you use a distribution that hand-holds basic things, it might
seem convenient at first, but as time goes on, you won't have a
clue when that fragile system fails.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent and reliable maintainence.</strong> Lastly, you'll want to
make sure that your distribution has humans on the development side
that are at least fixing basic problems. As programs change and are
updated, it often requires some changes in your distro's
repositories and more. Unmaintained distributions are usable, but it
becomes annoying to deal with as time goes on if you want to install
software with the distribution's package manager.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu</h2>
<p>Ubuntu is a common distribution because it is the distribution shilled
by the company Canonical. Canonical has probably had a positive effect
on making GNU/Linux more widely used and accessible, but Ubuntu has a
lot of long-term headaches that will plague users.</p>
<p>That said, <strong>Ubuntu is nearly the worst distribution for new users</strong>. It
is maintatined at least, but fails on all the metrics above:</p>
<ol>
<li>It advertises proprietary software in its software center and
encourages users to use programs because they are &quot;familiar&quot; from
Windows.</li>
<li>It releases slowly and you'll run into problems if you try to
install something out of the box.</li>
<li>It is full of gimicks, the elephant in the room being the Snap
system, but Canonical has thrown in a lot of junk features in the
past and a lot can break.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="debian">Debian</h2>
<p>Debian is just a more reasonable version of Ubuntu: it separates free
and non-free software clearly&mdash;it has a optional version that allows
unstable and testing packages for some recent software and it has so few
gimmicks it's probably the most boring distro!</p>
<p>I haven't used Debian much as a desktop system (I do use it on my
servers), but the package manager and even the release speed of the
testing versions isn't quite fast enough for me personally.</p>
<h2 id="artix-and-arch">Artix and Arch</h2>
<p><a href="https://artixlinux.org">Artix</a> is the distribution that I use and have
been using for a while. It is really the same thing as
<a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch</a>, except for Artix allows the usage of
different init systems (I use runit).</p>
<p>Arch and Arch-based distributions are &quot;bleeding-edge&quot; in their release
time and have access to the Arch User Repository (AUR) allowing the
single widest software library of all major Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Artix offers many installable desktop-environment ISOs for newbie users,
but thankfully they don't over-bloat them with gimmicky features. Arch
itself only has an official minimal installation, and that's kind of
its thing.</p>
<p><strong>If I had to choose, Artix is the distribution that I recommend for
both novice and most veteran users.</strong></p>
<h2 id="manjaro">Manjaro</h2>
<p>Manjaro is another Arch-based distro. I've even recommened it before
for new users in the past and installed it on many people's computers
in real life, but I will admit that my view on it is souring. They have
definitely started to go the way of Ubuntu by adding lots of extra
features, directly people to rely more on flatpak and &quot;harmful&quot;
systems and generally adding more layers of abstraction between the user
and the system.</p>
<p>All the good things that can be said about Manjaro can also be said of
<a href="https://artixlinux.org">Artix</a>, which also has easy to install ISOs, so
I consider Artix the superior system.</p>
<h2 id="parabola">Parabola</h2>
<p><a href="https://parabola.nu">Parabola</a> is the FSF-approved, all-free software
version of Arch Linux (it also has an OpenRC version for
soystemd-haters). In the abstract, Parabola is my optimal distribution,
but I don't actually use it anymore for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses the Linux-libre kernel, which is all free software, but
networking will not function with laptops with proprietary wifi
cards.</li>
<li>It is not quite as well maintained as Arch and Artix, and you'll be
a little more likely to run into package breakage.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second problem isn't the end of the world, but it can be annoying.</p>
<h2 id="gentoo">Gentoo</h2>
<p><a href="https://gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> is one of the best distributions and excels
in all of the 4 requirements I give. Not only is non-free software
obviously separated, but it isn't too difficult to have your Gentoo
install with a Linux-libre kernel if you want.</p>
<p>Gentoo is also unique because it is a source-based distribution: you can
set basic compilation settings for your programs and have a lot of
control over them. While Gentoo is very well maintained, <em>you</em> actually
end up with a good bit more control over your system. That is a
responsibility that has some prerequisite knowledge of course, so Gentoo
has a reputation of being difficult to install.</p>
<p>If you want to look into Gentoo, you should first be familiar with Linux
and what specific kind of system you want. When you first install
Gentoo, because you can customize it so specifically, it obviously helps
to know what exact network backend you're comfortable with, whether you
want to use GTK or QT, or many other little things that a Linux noob
might not know too much about.</p>
<h2 id="void">Void</h2>
<p><a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void</a> is another great distribution. It's
notable also for using runit instead of soystemd, having a musl version,
and having a package system reminiscent of Arch, but in many ways more
minimalist and extensible. It again separates free and non-free
packages, and has a wide repository of them, included even more
installable via the <code>xbps-src</code> system which is somewhat analogous to the
AUR, although unlike the AUR, I don't believe it's quite as easy to
update packages.</p>
<p>Void has had a somewhat tumultuous development culture. It was
originally the brainchild of one man, one man who went missing for a
year... After he returned, drama eventually caused other member of the
team to encourage his retirement. Either way, while I used the distro
for a while and was one of the first people advertising it online, I
never remember this translating into any downstream problems on my
computer.</p>
<h2 id="distro-not-here">Distro not here?</h2>
<p>This is only a list of distributions that I've used for a bit. I don't
do &quot;distro reviews&quot; or just install random distributions just to test
them, so if it isn't here, I'm not going to have an experience-based
opinion.</p>
