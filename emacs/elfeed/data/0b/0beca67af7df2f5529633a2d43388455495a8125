<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been using arch for many years different computers and always managed to solve any issues but scratching my head with this one.</p> <p>My current laptop has nvidia rtx 3070 attached to usb c display port.</p> <p>The amd gpu is attached to hdmi port</p> <p>I was successfully using render offload to use two external monitors one via hdmi and one via usb c / display port.</p> <p>I have just purchased a usb c display port hub so I can add another monitor and run all three from the display port.</p> <p>This is where it gets a bit strange.</p> <p>Initially both external screens and laptop screen worked fine once plugged in however an occasional issue where one external monitor wouldn&#39;t show the desktop until reboot.</p> <p>I re did xranr auto etc as stated on arch wiki in which the laptop screen would not display but both externals now displayed but on removing the externals the laptop screen would still not show which is not good for when mobile.</p> <p>Tried again using render offload and xrandr auto etc and this time all displayed once more on reboot and laptop screen worked as it should but same issue with one of external screens would sometimes not work unless reboot.</p> <p>Attempted to reinstall amdgpu driver which resulted in all working but very slow due to using the on board graphics.</p> <p>Once again followed render offload on wiki and rebooted, nvidia card now being used once more so fast but same issue occurs with one screen sometimes not working unt reboot.</p> <p>Very frustrating.... is there anyone else with the same issues or a work around, ideally want it sorting before my third monitor arrives.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dreamsuk"> /u/dreamsuk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7ke3t/prop_nvidia_amdgpu_display_port_usb_c_hub/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7ke3t/prop_nvidia_amdgpu_display_port_usb_c_hub/">[comments]</a></span>
