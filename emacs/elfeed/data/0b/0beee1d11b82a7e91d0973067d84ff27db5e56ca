<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am very impressed by adults who have more life responsibilities than kids and obtain these titles. There are some episode on Perpetual Chess Podcast, in which adult improvers talk about their experience. So I am curious that how long it took you to achieve (one of) these titles, and what your training routine was/is like?</p> <p>I am about 1600 on Lichess Classical and my goal is to obtain a FM title in the future. I am currently working through some books like Yusupov 1, <em>100 Endgames You Must Know</em>, and <em>Starting Out: The Sicilian Defense</em>.</p> <p>Thank you for your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hedgehog0"> /u/hedgehog0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w8ksaf/adult_players_who_made_nmcmfm_titles_what_wasis/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w8ksaf/adult_players_who_made_nmcmfm_titles_what_wasis/">[comments]</a></span>
