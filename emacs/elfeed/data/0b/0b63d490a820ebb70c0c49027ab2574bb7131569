<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I jumped in the Org / DooM bandwagon in 2020.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using emacs on my phone and tablet (termux), and laptop (*nix), predominantly for GTD stuff. It works for me because it&#39;s keyboard based, and on all my devices.</p> <p>I see the weekly tip thread in this sub, but most of them are way more advanced than the level I&#39;m at.</p> <p>Had anyone got any noob friendly tips about general emacs capabilities to explore?</p> <p>My current workflow / level is:</p> <ul> <li>Open org files from bookmark (dired)</li> <li>Edit and save org file</li> <li>if there are conflicts (damn you syncthing), resolve with ediff</li> <li>if anything goes &quot;weird&quot; kill buffer / delete window until back to the fallback buffer - then try again.</li> </ul> <p>I had some luck early on with tasker and bash scripts to manipulate org files based on various conditions - but I&#39;ve long forgotten how all that works.</p> <p>Similarly, I tried to get notmuch mail setup two years ago, but ran into trouble with gmail and exchabge authentication </p> <p>Would love to hear your suggestions for my emacs journey.</p> <p>I&#39;ve also asked if there are any org-specific things I can try on the org-mode sub</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thephatmaster"> /u/thephatmaster </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w16sdr/two_years_on_need_tips/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w16sdr/two_years_on_need_tips/">[comments]</a></span>
