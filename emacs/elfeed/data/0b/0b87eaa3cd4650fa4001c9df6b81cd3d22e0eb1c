<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Even to the extent that concert and recording programmes refer to a ‘Bach piano concerto’? I don’t have a problem with Bach being played on a piano, but it feels weird that it’s normalised to the extent that pieces are being listed as piano concertos when they’re not. I’ve no problem with someone playing a violin concerto on an electric violin, or a clarinet concerto on a saxophone, if people want to do it, but I wouldn’t expect to see it simply listed as the Mozart saxophone concerto… Just a thought that often crosses my mind…</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JH0190"> /u/JH0190 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/137senv/does_it_strike_anyone_else_as_odd_that_its_so/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/137senv/does_it_strike_anyone_else_as_odd_that_its_so/">[comments]</a></span>
