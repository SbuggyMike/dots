Robert Reich: <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#corrupter">the corrupter</a> should be barred from running for office
because of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/24/trump-treason-constitution-election-republicans-robert-reich">his involvement in attempted insurrection</a>.
<p>
The article uses the word "treason" to describe this.  In everyday
informal terms, that word fits; but it is better to be precise in this
context, because the Constitution gives a definition of "treason" which
is much narrower: fighting against the US on behalf of an enemy country.
For clarity, we should say "insurrection".
