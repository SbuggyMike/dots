<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL;DR: Danya is the most amazing explainer of opening concepts. I made <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR4Q8340cD3LBR_FIReH2qmaVAR7sVYQRvuIQWMaWieQ-esH6yFtK7qAHIxYZf6pIk-32kH1aUDLyyT/pubhtml">a Google Sheet</a> indexing every opening played in all 4 of Danya&#39;s speed-runs, along with timestamps when there are multiple games in a single video.</p> <p>When I am learning a new opening, there is nothing better than watching Danya play it against many different opponents, explaining slightly different concepts every time. Many youtubers&#39; opening videos are like &quot;if he plays x1, you play x2, if he plays y1, I like to play y2,&quot; but often don&#39;t explain why. Danya is all about the concepts behind the moves.</p> <p>It&#39;s also super useful to see how he plays openings against intermediate opponents — as an intermediate player, I find it hard to figure out for myself why, e.g. 2. Bc4 in the Sicilian is a bad move — there is no direct refutation, and it&#39;s hard to figure out either from Stockfish or the opening explorer what exactly is wrong with it. But Danya&#39;s explanations are crystal clear.</p> <p>I included his rating and color in each game so it&#39;s possible to study openings at the ability level you want.</p> <p>Some entries are missing, I&#39;m still catching up on the latest speedrun, and I&#39;m sure I made mistakes. I hope this is as useful to some of you as it has been to me.</p> <p>And a big thank you to <a href="/u/GMNaroditsky">u/GMNaroditsky</a> for the incredibly clear and patient videos. I hope the series never ends!</p> <p>EDIT: Here&#39;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18TXkacdPTHEcmqs4M7ySo7QBaZpsN-g1/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=107629374413295796239&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">a link to a downloadable Excel sheet</a>, but obv it will not be updated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ookinizay"> /u/ookinizay </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wisv5f/i_made_an_index_of_every_opening_in_daniel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wisv5f/i_made_an_index_of_every_opening_in_daniel/">[comments]</a></span>
