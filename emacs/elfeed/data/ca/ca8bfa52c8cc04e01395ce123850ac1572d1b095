<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My first ever PC was with an AMD gpu. When it&#39;s Hard drive was on it&#39;s knees I switched to linux. For a lot of things the performance improved but for gaming performance worsened. I played CSGO then and all of the benchmarks suggest better performance. I even talked to a dude with a gt 610 who before switching to linux barely got 50fps but when he did he got 100+ fps. At the moment I am an unfortunate Windows user hoping one day I&#39;ll get back to Linux without triggering my family, since I have a gtx 1650 now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RepresentativeWalk60"> /u/RepresentativeWalk60 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wc6h7x/why_is_nvidia_hated_so_much_by_linux_users/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wc6h7x/why_is_nvidia_hated_so_much_by_linux_users/">[comments]</a></span>
