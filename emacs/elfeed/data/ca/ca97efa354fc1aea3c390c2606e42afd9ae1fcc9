I followed the arch wiki and created a 20-amdgpu.conf and put the option for no tearing and freesync to on. the tearfree worked and it changed from auto to on but the freesync(vrr)is still 0. this command <code>xrandr --output HDMI-A-0 --set vrr_capable 1</code></p> <p>it worked but the change dont persist on reboot</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mindless-Victory1567"> /u/Mindless-Victory1567 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb95i9/how_to_enable_freesync_on_startup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb95i9/how_to_enable_freesync_on_startup/">[comments]</a></span>
