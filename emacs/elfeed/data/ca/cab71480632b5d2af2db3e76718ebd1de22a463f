<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I spent a year avoiding Ubuntu whilst dual booting because it got like a quarter of the battery life as Windows. I had to go around hunting to find out about this TLP thing, and it works like a miracle you install it and you start it and you get a dramatic increase in battery life without any noticeable impact in functionality. It&#39;s pretty amazing but</p> <p><strong>why is this not built in</strong>?</p> <p>I just recently clean installed Ubuntu 22.04, and I noticed they added some power management to the settings. I think to myself &quot;it&#39;s about gosh darn time&quot; then just today I&#39;m sitting there not even watching videos I&#39;m just browsing the web and after an hour, half of my battery is gone.</p> <p>I do a little research and it turns out the power management they included is rubbish. All it really does is CPU throttling. I remove it and install TLP and the battery reports going from 8 watts at idle down to 6 Watts.</p> <p>The battery life on Ubuntu out of the box on a laptop is so bad it&#39;s going to turn people away why would they not include TLP by default when being installed bare metal on a laptop?</p> <p>(I haven&#39;t really tried any other distributions on battery so I can&#39;t speak to anything other than Ubuntu but I read Fedora has a similar issue)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jmpz11"> /u/jmpz11 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vxqqgk/why_isnt_tlp_installed_by_default_on_laptops/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vxqqgk/why_isnt_tlp_installed_by_default_on_laptops/">[comments]</a></span>
