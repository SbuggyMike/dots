<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I added <code>i915</code> in MODULES <code>/etc/mkinitcpio.conf</code>. I have also added <code>i915.fastboot=1</code> as kernel parameter so that my screen doesn&#39;t went black for a moment while booting. It doesn&#39;t went black as expected. But, while booting it puts huge gap before <code>[OK] Load kernel modules</code> text. This is happening because I have sd-encrypt hook. No problem whatsoever when you don&#39;t have sd-encrypt.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/windows_sucks_"> /u/windows_sucks_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyria1/i915_kernel_module_puts_huge_spacegap_between/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyria1/i915_kernel_module_puts_huge_spacegap_between/">[comments]</a></span>
