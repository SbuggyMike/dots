<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find really good words to describe these; they&#39;re mellow and serene, they happen to all be in a major key but I&#39;ve felt like crying to them and I can&#39;t put my finger on why. Can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re tears of joy? loss? a mix of everything? With the Bach cello piece, it makes me feel grateful for something, but also something like sweet remembrance after a loss. All of these pieces though have this perfectly beautiful element, in a gorgeous mirror structure (all are in two parts, tonic- &gt; dominant and dominant -&gt; tonic) with long and elegant melodies. Sorry the selection is kinda small, if I think of more I&#39;ll add them.</p> <p>Bach - Sarabande from Keyboard Partita No. 1 in Bb major, BWV 825</p> <p>Bach - Sarabande from Cello Suite No. 6 in D major, BWV 1012</p> <p>Mozart - Second movement of Piano Sonata No. 8 in A minor, K. 310</p> <p>There are a lot of other pieces people might consider to be similar but I didn&#39;t include them because they&#39;re missing some factor that I&#39;m really looking for, for example the Air from Bach&#39;s Orchestral Suite No. 3 or the Sarabande from his Keyboard Partita No. 4, and a lot of Mozart&#39;s slow movements. While I find them really beautiful they don&#39;t have the sumptuous makes-me-tear-up factor that&#39;s hard to describe. Thank you for any suggestions. While his work is cool, please no Chopin because I&#39;ve heard all his stuff to death, thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/choerry_bomb"> /u/choerry_bomb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wewwpi/what_are_some_pieces_similar_to_these/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wewwpi/what_are_some_pieces_similar_to_these/">[comments]</a></span>
