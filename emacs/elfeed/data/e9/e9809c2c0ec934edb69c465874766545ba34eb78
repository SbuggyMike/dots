<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Corel WordPerfect 8 for Linux Server Edition was the last version to include a character-mode version, which was amazingly fast. There&#39;s now a project to make it work on current Linux distros, and the character-mode version 7 is already supported here:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/taviso/wpunix">https://github.com/taviso/wpunix</a></p> <p>Does anyone have a copy of version 8 Server Edition that you might be willing to share with this project? Many thanks for any help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VintageNewYork"> /u/VintageNewYork </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w41ow7/looking_for_corel_wordperfect_8_for_linux_server/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w41ow7/looking_for_corel_wordperfect_8_for_linux_server/">[comments]</a></span>
