<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>So I am kind of at a crossroads. I have used doom emacs for a few days and fell in love with emacs. So I decided to try to build the EMACS config from scratch. I also plan to learn elisp. The only worry I have is will there come a time where ELISP is not enough for EMACS and emacs stops being extended or used? </p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Maybe the question should be is there or will there be a limit imposed on the elisp languages&#39; ability to improve EMACS?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AwesomeGuy1990"> /u/AwesomeGuy1990 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w72poo/will_there_come_a_time_when_elisp_is_not_enough/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w72poo/will_there_come_a_time_when_elisp_is_not_enough/">[comments]</a></span>
