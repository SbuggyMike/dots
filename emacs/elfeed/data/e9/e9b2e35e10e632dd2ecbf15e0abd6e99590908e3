The European Union is proposing a system of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-online-child-abuse-law-make-us-less-safe/">massive surveillance of
all internet communication</a>, in the name of "protecting children".
<p>
The two standard excuses for proposing repressive measures are
"protecting children" and "stopping terrorism".  These goals, while
valid, are perfect for making citizens panic and rush to support the
measures despite their danger.
<p>
MEP Patrick Breyer, who opposes the scheme,
has prepared <a href="https://chatcontrol.eu/">a web site that explains a lot more</a>.
