<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Without a compositor, I can just run <code>/usr/lib/xscreensaver/cubicgrid -root &amp;</code> in my <code>.xprofile</code> and the Cubic Grid screensaver is now my wallpaper, easy. Since I got picom working, though, the wallpaper is an ugly gray. I found out how to set it to black with hsetroot, but I can&#39;t get cubicgrid to work anymore. Any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thecakeisalie25"> /u/Thecakeisalie25 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/weoloy/use_xscreensaver_as_wallpaper_w_picom/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/weoloy/use_xscreensaver_as_wallpaper_w_picom/">[comments]</a></span>
