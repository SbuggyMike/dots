<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Never been that much into classical music, my friend was creating a youtube channel in lunch break and I asked him &quot;what are you creating?&quot;, he said &quot;a classical music channel&quot;.<br/> I was a bit confused at first, why would you make a classical music channel if there&#39;s already the actual music out there? and he explained to me that there was more to it such as the playlists.<br/> He sent me the first video ever and I&#39;m currently vibing to it while doing my homework, I had no idea that I liked classical music, it&#39;s awesome!!</p> <p>If any of you are interested in hearing my friend&#39;s playlist here&#39;s a link! <a href="https://youtu.be/VZVQ8l1BUfo">https://youtu.be/VZVQ8l1BUfo</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/willkingxx"> /u/willkingxx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13jax1k/a_friend_of_mine_started_a_classical_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13jax1k/a_friend_of_mine_started_a_classical_music/">[comments]</a></span>
