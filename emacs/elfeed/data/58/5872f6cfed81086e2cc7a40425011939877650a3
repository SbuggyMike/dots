<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings Arch community,</p> <p>Recently <code>chrome-gnome-shell</code> (the native browser connector for integration with <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org">extensions.gnome.org</a>) has gone out of date and appears to no longer work. If you try to install an extension on the Gnome Extensions website, you&#39;ll be greeted with an error message at the top of the browser saying something like one of the following messages:</p> <blockquote> <p>Although GNOME Shell integration extension is running, native host connector is not detected. Refer <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation">[documentation]</a> for instructions about installing connector. </p> <p>Your native host connector do not support following APIs: v6. Probably you should upgrade native host connector or install plugins for missing APIs. Refer <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation">[documentation]</a> for instructions.</p> </blockquote> <p>I&#39;m not entirely familiar with what is currently happening upstream, but it looks like the devs are trying to split <code>gnome-browser-extension</code> and <code>gnome-browser-connector</code> to prevent some kind of confusion from happening. Outside of that I&#39;m not sure the reasoning for this current issue.</p> <p>For now <code>chrome-gnome-shell</code> is out of date (and <code>chrome-gnome-shell-git</code> won&#39;t even build), so to fix this issue thankfully that same maintainer has put the new <code>gnome-browser-connector</code> package in the AUR for us, so if you use and trust the maintainer of <code>chrome-gnome-shell</code>, you can be confident to trust this <code>gnome-browser-connector</code> package since it&#39;s from the same maintainer.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tested both <code>gnome-browser-connector</code> and <code>gnome-browser-connector-git</code> and with either package installed, you can successfully install extensions via the Gnome Extensions website again if you so choose to. Just make sure you have removed <code>chrome-gnome-shell</code> beforehand.</p> <p>Feel free to check out the <code>gnome-browser-connector</code> AUR packages: <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&amp;SeB=nd&amp;K=gnome-browser-connector&amp;outdated=&amp;SB=p&amp;SO=d&amp;PP=50&amp;submit=Go">HERE</a></p> <p>Of course it&#39;s worth mentioning that you can still use the GUI GTK4 app <code>extension-manager</code> to add/remove/install extensions as well, which is in the AUR as well: <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&amp;SeB=nd&amp;K=extension-manager&amp;outdated=&amp;SB=p&amp;SO=d&amp;PP=50&amp;submit=Go">HERE</a></p> <p>Hope this helps anyone that might come across this! This fix may be subject to change in the future perhaps, so if it does, I&#39;ll update it accordingly.</p> <p>Edit1: Here&#39;s a Gitlab post for <code>gnome-shell</code> that explains a bit more detail about this issue: <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/5622">HERE</a></p> <p>Edit2: Also found a Gitlab issue for Extensions-Web aware of the problem: <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/extensions-web/-/issues/194">HERE</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dswhite85"> /u/dswhite85 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyaxbe/heres_how_to_fix_recent_gnome_extensions_website/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyaxbe/heres_how_to_fix_recent_gnome_extensions_website/">[comments]</a></span>
