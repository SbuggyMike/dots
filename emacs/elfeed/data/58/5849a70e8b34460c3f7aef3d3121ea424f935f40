<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sometimes, I wish the Linux community would co-operate more. Today, I tested whether Timeshift would work on Fedora, which by default uses BTRFS. Nope—Timeshift expects the root and home subvolumes to be @ and @home respectively, and it won’t work with the default BTRFS configuration of Fedora. Timeshift is using an Ubuntu convention when Ubuntu doesn’t even ship with BTRFS by default. This doesn’t make any sense to me. When I tried to fix the issue by changing the subvolume names, the VM became unbootable.</p> <p>I really don’t understand why Fedora doesn’t have a built-in snapshot tool if it ships with BTRFS by default, or why Timeshift only supports a very narrow set of configurations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alex_Strgzr"> /u/Alex_Strgzr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whs63x/fedora_btrfs_and_timeshift/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whs63x/fedora_btrfs_and_timeshift/">[comments]</a></span>
