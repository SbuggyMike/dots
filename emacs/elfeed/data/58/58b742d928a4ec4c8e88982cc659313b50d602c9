<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently wiped my SSD, and used archinstall to reinstall arch linux on my main machine (basic install, using the desktop/qtile profile). Everything worked fine, until I edited the default qtile config. Nothing crazy, just changed the workspace names, which seems to have broken qtile... After reloading, qtile stopped working, instead of loading the default config (which is the intended behavior for invalid configs), leaving me with an almost &quot;zombie like&quot; non-working x-session. Killing qtile and logging in with lightdm doesn&#39;t work (I get dropped back to lightdm). Manually running startx from a tty and starting qtile from there, outputs this (other window managers work fine, reinstalling qtile doesn&#39;t fix the problem):</p> <p>EDIT: running qtile as root works without any errors</p> <pre><code>2022-07-31 17:03:45,559 libqtile start.py:start():L94 Qtile crashed Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/libqtile/backend/x11/core.py&quot;, line 444, in lookup_key keysym = xcbq.get_keysym(key.key) File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/libqtile/backend/x11/xcbq.py&quot;, line 793, in get_keysym raise XCBQError(&quot;Unknown key: %s&quot; % key) libqtile.backend.x11.xcbq.XCBQError: Unknown key: 1 During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred: Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/libqtile/scripts/start.py&quot;, line 92, in start q.loop() File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/libqtile/core/manager.py&quot;, line 192, in loop asyncio.run(self.async_loop()) File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/asyncio/runners.py&quot;, line 44, in run return loop.run_until_complete(main) File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/asyncio/base_events.py&quot;, line 646, in run_until_complete return future.result() File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/libqtile/core/manager.py&quot;, line 217, in async_loop self.load_config(initial=True) File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/libqtile/core/manager.py&quot;, line 138, in load_config self.grab_key(key) File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/libqtile/core/manager.py&quot;, line 408, in grab_key keysym, mask_key = self.core.grab_key(key) File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/libqtile/backend/x11/core.py&quot;, line 453, in grab_key keysym, modmask = self.lookup_key(key) File &quot;/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/libqtile/backend/x11/core.py&quot;, line 447, in lookup_key raise utils.QtileError(err) libqtile.utils.QtileError: Unknown key: 1 </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/plank_changed"> /u/plank_changed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcpwfp/qtile_crashes_upon_launching_as_regular_user/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcpwfp/qtile_crashes_upon_launching_as_regular_user/">[comments]</a></span>
