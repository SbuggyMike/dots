<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have both windows 10 and arch partitions in my computer and while i use arch for most of my other needs i use windows 10 for gaming. My computer shut itself yesterday while i was browsing the net on my windows partition. FIrst i thought it was a hardware problem but i get 44.0 C on my arch installation while on Windows it goes from 60 to 100 c on idle I still rely on Windows for gaming and i&#39;m pretty much scared to start up any of my games. While this is not an arch issue any help would be nice.</p> <p>TLDR: My CPU heat on Arch seems to be fine but on windows its on dangerous territory.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Darkmatter497"> /u/Darkmatter497 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg9ry2/my_cpu_heat_is_not_consistent_between_my_arch_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg9ry2/my_cpu_heat_is_not_consistent_between_my_arch_and/">[comments]</a></span>
