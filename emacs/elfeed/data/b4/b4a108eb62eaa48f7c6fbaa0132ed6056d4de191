<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just an idea to hear more about all our colorful openings in a concise and fun manner, pretend to be salesmen and pitch us your opening. Why do you like it? Is it tried and true? How? Is it solid? Sharp? How so? What exactly are we to expect on the board? Played by all the greats? Allows you to play with a bigger room for error? Make an ad if you have to.</p> <p>Let&#39;s try to make it more fun than &quot;it&#39;s solid and has good percentages...&quot;, really give it your all and show us some enthusiasm. In short, why should we play your favorite opening?</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I&#39;ll start:</p> <p><strong>The Caro-Kann:</strong></p> <p><em>Imagine a video of Magnus Carlsen driving a sports car along Highway 1, in his best suit, spaceship dashboard, narrating the following (ad for the new chessable course or something, I know Carlsen is not exactly famous for his Caro but suspend disbelief):</em></p> <p>Let&#39;s face it. You&#39;re no Bobby Fischer. You&#39;re not Stockfish. You&#39;re not me.</p> <p>Most of the time, what you need is a good, dependable and solid opening. Everybody makes mistakes, but everybody deserves a second chance... well, maybe not everybody (Nepo&#39;s face flashes across the screen).</p> <p>With the Caro-Kann, you&#39;ll have an opening that is approved by top grandmasters, played at the very highest level, and will hold your defenses intact even if the enemy battering ram somehow finds its to your gates.</p> <p>You are the castle. You are its walls. Its moats and its trenches. Does that sound dull and hopeless to you?</p> <p>Caro-Kann.</p> <p>By champions, for champions.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>And the camera lifts off the ground from behind as he drives off along the western sunset.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nagelbitarn"> /u/nagelbitarn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w8p1t5/sell_us_your_favorite_opening/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w8p1t5/sell_us_your_favorite_opening/">[comments]</a></span>
