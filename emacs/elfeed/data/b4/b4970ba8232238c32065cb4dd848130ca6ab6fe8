It's amazing how often officials illegally conceal exculpatory
evidence and succeed in bringing about an abortion of justice.  (The
word "miscarriage" is a mistaken metaphor because they happen by

US as a result of such deception.  These prosecutors have to know they
are lying someone into prison or (in the US) into the death row.  Why
don't we put them in prison for this?
