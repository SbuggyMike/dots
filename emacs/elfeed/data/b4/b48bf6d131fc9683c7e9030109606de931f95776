We kind of grew apart. Nobody realized I was going to become a top chess player. No one else in my family played the game, so they didn’t really understand it at all. My mother wanted me to become an accountant, while I wanted to leave school and turn professional. So they left me in the Philippines when I’d just turned 16, and emigrated to Canada. I drifted for a while, squatting in an apartment in Manila owned by the chess federation, but it often had no electricity. I got some monthly support, and I’d play and win tournaments here and there, but I was just drifting for several years, until I got the opportunity to move to the U.S. in 2012.</p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CrispeeLipss"> /u/CrispeeLipss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wflvsd/til_wesley_so_is_estranged_from_his_biological/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wflvsd/til_wesley_so_is_estranged_from_his_biological/">[comments]</a></span>
