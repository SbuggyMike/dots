<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good morning, Happy Monday (the least happy day of the week) and welcome to another selection for our sub&#39;s weekly listening club. Each week, we&#39;ll listen to a piece recommended by the community, discuss it, learn about it, and hopefully introduce us to music we wouldn&#39;t hear otherwise :)</p> <p>Last week, we listened to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/12yiofr/potw_60_strauss_oboe_concerto/">Strauss’ Oboe Concerto</a>. You can go back to listen, read up, and discuss the work if you want to. </p> <p>Our next Piece of the Week is <strong>Albert Roussel’s Bacchus et Ariane, Ballet Suite no.2 (1934)</strong></p> <p>…</p> <p><strong>Score from IMSLP</strong></p> <p><a href="https://imslp.hk/files/imglnks/euimg/3/3b/IMSLP21612-PMLP15213-Roussel_-_Bacchus_et_Ariane,_Op._43_(Suite_No._2).pdf">https://imslp.hk/files/imglnks/euimg/3/3b/IMSLP21612-PMLP15213-Roussel_-_Bacchus_et_Ariane,_Op._43_(Suite_No._2).pdf</a></p> <p>...</p> <p>some listening notes from <a href="https://arts.ucdavis.edu/post/roussel-bacchus-et-ariane-ballet-suite-no-2">Kern Holoman</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Albert Roussel (1869–1937) was a contemporary of Maurice Ravel who wrote extensively for the ballet. His music is marked by the influence of Debussy and Ravel. He was interested in exotic topics, lavish orchestral colors, complex harmonies, and strong rhythms, all while keeping a classical sense of form. In addition to numerous ballets, he wrote four symphonies, some wonderful songs, and a significant body of chamber music. Bacchus and Ariadne was premiered at the Paris Opéra in 1931, as a two-act ballet. The second suite is equivalent to the second act of the ballet.</p> <p>The myth of Bacchus (i. e., Dionysus, god of ecstasy and of the grape) and Ariadne has captivated numerous artists since Homer, Hesiod and Ovid: the Italian painter Titian (16th century), the Russian playwright Chekhov, Nietzsche, and Richard Strauss (Ariadne auf Naxos). Ariadne was the daughter of King Minos of Crete. She helped the great hero Theseus escape from the deadly labyrinth which had been built by her father. She eloped with Theseus to the island of Naxos, where Theseus promptly abandoned her. The second act of the ballet opens with Ariadne still asleep. She stirs, looks for Theseus, realizes he has abandoned her, climbs to the top of the island throws herself off, in despair. Fortunately, Bacchus, king of wine and all Earthly things, arrives at the same instant, and catches her. He rapidly makes her forget Theseus. He is funny, congenial and rotund, just the opposite of Theseus. They kiss. The island becomes enchanted. They dance with increasing abandon. In the end, Ariadne is carried off in a chariot by Bacchus and a throng of well-wishers. She ascends to Mount Olympia and becomes a goddess.</p> <p>It was Pierre Monteux, 25 years his senior, who in 1933 offered Charles Munch his first repertoire niche as conductor: the Bacchus and Ariadne suites. Bacchus and Ariadne, descending so obviously from Ravel’s Daphnis and Chloé, demanded similar treatment as a pair of concert suites: excising the extraneous theater-specific bars and leaving as much as possible exactly as in the ballet. That much had been clear since the 1931 premiere conducted by Philippe Gaubert, its only performance to date. Monteux moved forward with the idea and secured the composer’s participation in refashioning the score, then offered Munch one of the two suites to perfect and premiere. Hence it was Munch who gave the first performance of Suite No. 1 in April 1933; Monteux then introduced Suite No. 2 the next season, in February 1934. According to Dutilleux, the result owed “some of its success to Munch’s cuts. It was Munch who gave the suite its shape by making cuts that Roussel, I’m sure, never envisaged.” Munch, who had “an inborn sense of proportion,” went on to suggest similar cuts to many composers, not least of whom was Dutilleux himself. He conducted Bacchus and Ariadne Suite No. 2 (and the Berlioz Symphonie fantastique) in Raleigh the night before his death.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ways to Listen</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Alain Altinoglu and the hr-Sinfonieorchester: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVV-tZPKdEg">YouTube</a></p></li> <li><p>Stéphane Denève and the Brussels Philharmonic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhdaXfa55kY">YouTube</a></p></li> <li><p>Lorin Maazel and la Orcestra Filarmonica della Scala: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp43Qm209wI">YouTube</a></p></li> <li><p>Kazuki Yamada and the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0Jw5FmZ5Hn5HzWH4rrj9MB?si=50ia4xb3Se-UbFbGk3zxEg">Spotify</a></p></li> <li><p>Georges Prêtre and the Orchestre National de France: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7DoKhlyGttTqIYBXzoW9kG?si=xq46RfltS62pu1hhmJCFUA">Spotify</a></p></li> <li><p>Neeme Järvi and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7dQLCVC8NqRyV8xy3di3oE?si=PJOAHSDfQ0KrQSsuBMCpyg">Spotify</a></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Discussion Prompts</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>What are your favorite parts or moments in this work?
