  US citizens: call on Congress to <a href="https://act.freepress.net/sign/fund-public-media">fund Public Media</a>.

Corporate "sponsors" have too much influence over US public media.  As
usual, they use that influence to slant coverage and adjust the
Overton window.  With more public funds, public media could resist
their influence more.
