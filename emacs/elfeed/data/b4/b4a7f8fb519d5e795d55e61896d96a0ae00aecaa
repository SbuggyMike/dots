Ecuador has reached a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/01/ecuador-deal-reached-to-end-weeks-of-deadly-protests-and-strikes">harmful deal</a> to end indigenous protests: cutting
the fossil fuel price.
<p>
This eases the immediate suffering of the poor, at the cost of making
future suffering worse for them and everyone else.
<p>
The right way to help poor people cope with various kinds of high prices
is to give them extra money which is <em>independent</em> of the amount of
fossil fuel they use.
<p>
The desl also includes stricter geographic limits on search for and
exploiting fossil fuel.  That part is good.
