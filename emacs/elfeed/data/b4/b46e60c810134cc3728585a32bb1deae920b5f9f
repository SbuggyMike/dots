<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have you ever asked yourself what happens when you see “command not found” on bash? This writeup is not going to talk about that and not about the flow which determines if a command is found or not (that is a topic for a different write up ;-).</p> <p>I am going to focus my discussion on what happens in an environment based on bash + Ubuntu (version 22.04). I guess you at least once wrote “sl” instead of “ls” and you got a message “Command &#39;sl&#39; not found, but can be installed with: sudo apt install sl” - how did bash know that there is such a package that could be installed? - as shown in the screenshot below</p> <p>Overall, the magic happens with the python script “/usr/lib/command-not-found” which is executed when a bash does not find a command - as shown in the screenshot below. This feature is based on an sqlite database that has a connection between command and packages, it is sorted in “/var/lib/command-not-found/commands.db”.</p> <p>Lastly, there is a nice website <a href="https://command-not-found.com/">https://command-not-found.com/</a> which allows you to search for a command and get a list of different ways of installing it (for different Linux distributions/Windows/MacOS/Docker/etc). </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/lqdiuko6xcwa1.png?width=1133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0994107b63819ab5d84b5400c20ce24715d2c74c">https://preview.redd.it/lqdiuko6xcwa1.png?width=1133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0994107b63819ab5d84b5400c20ce24715d2c74c</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/boutnaru"> /u/boutnaru </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/130a4id/have_you_ever_asked_yourself_what_happens_when/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/130a4id/have_you_ever_asked_yourself_what_happens_when/">[comments]</a></span>
