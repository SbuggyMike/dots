The difference between Teixeira, who leaked secret military memos this
year, and whistleblowers such as Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden,
is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-pentagon-leaks-this-system-puts-lives-at-risk">matter of motive</a>.
  The whistleblowers wanted to serve the public; Teixeira was motivated
by bad wishes.

We must revise the Espionage Act to include a public interest
justification.  For Manning and Snowden, it would have exonerated them
and probably discouraged prosecuting them at all.  For Teixeira, it
would have changed nothing.
