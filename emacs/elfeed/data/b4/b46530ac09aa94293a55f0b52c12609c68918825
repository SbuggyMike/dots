<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, American here still trying to learn Cricket. I think I&#39;ve got the basics down to the point I can watch a match and understand basically what is going on. But every once in a while I&#39;ll be watching and something happens that doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Here is one example:</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOl_BwtkAeU&amp;t=743s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOl_BwtkAeU&amp;t=743s</a></p> <p>At the bottom left it says &quot;PAK 363-8 1st Inns&quot;. As I understand it this means that Pakistan has 363 runs and 8 of their batsmen been put out, correct? And then the bowler bowls and the batsman chips one to the wicket keeper who catches him out. That makes 9 wickets. But then the announcer says, &quot;That&#39;s going to end the innings.&quot; and everybody starts high fiving and leaving the field. Then it cuts to &quot;ENG 0-0 2nd Inns&quot;. Can somebody explain why that ended the innings? I thought all 10 players had to be put out to end the innings.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/framptal_tromwibbler"> /u/framptal_tromwibbler </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w7dy5p/why_did_this_end_the_innings/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w7dy5p/why_did_this_end_the_innings/">[comments]</a></span>
