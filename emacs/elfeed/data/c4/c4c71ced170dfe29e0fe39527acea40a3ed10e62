<p>&#8216;The Supreme Court, in the recent decision of Routier v Revenue and Customs Commissioners (No 2) [2019] UKSC 43, [2019] 3 WLR 757, has provided valuable guidance as to the scope of s. 23 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (which exempts gifts to charities from IHT). The case is a welcome decision for private clients and their estate planners wishing to support international charitable causes while simultaneously benefitting from reduced liability to inheritance tax.&#8217;</p>
