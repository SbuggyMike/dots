[Asked about the decision to bowl first at the toss] I feel that the strategy to play with one extra fast bowler backfired whereas KL used an extra spinner. I tried to change something and it didn&#39;t work but that&#39;s all right. It&#39;s a good learning for me and we&#39;ll come back better stronger. [Asked about Shahrukh held back to No. 8] There was no particular reason. Livi was there and even Sam hits quite well so that&#39;s how we kept it. [Using the impact sub] It&#39;s good. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#39;t but that&#39;s how it is.&quot;</p> <p><strong>LSG wk Nicholas Pooran:</strong> &quot;I think we are more happy that we got those two points at the end of the night. I felt it was a really good batting wicket. The bowlers, we knew that there was one big side and one short side and once you can control the Powerplay, we were going to try to make the batters hit into the bigger side. [On the review not taken down the leg side] I&#39;m under some pressure taking some reviews right now. Of late, I haven&#39;t been successful taking reviews so I&#39;ll let that one pass today. [On wk practice] I don&#39;t really do much to be honest. I believe the less I practice, I keep better. It&#39;s all about catching the ball with soft hands and keeping it simple. [On not reaching 50] Unfortunately, but so it goes. I&#39;m happy to contribute to the team performance. There&#39;s times as batsmen we don&#39;t score much runs but I&#39;ll take 40-odd any day.&quot;</p> <p><strong>LSG captain KL Rahul:</strong> &quot;We would have chased as well in this game [had we won the toss]/ The last game was a bit of a downer and did hurt a lot of us as a team but we had three or four days break after that which was good. Everyone got their minds off cricket and just rested. Obviously when we play back home, the wickets are different and challenging and when you come to play on wickets like this, you get excited as a batter. Getting 250 or 260 speaks very highly of our batting. Those first two or three overs, Kyle put pressure on their bowling and that set the tone for us and we took it from there. We spend a lot of time thinking about what tactics we can use. We have three power-hitters in Kyle, Pooran and Stoinis and then guys who can bat around them. We just try to use players in situations and see how we can get the best out of them.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Marcus Stoinis is named Player of the Match:</strong> [Asked about his injured finger] It&#39;s been all right. It&#39;s been better. [Asked about batting] We were joking about that talking about the different between our surface at home and this beautiful batting wicket. [On batting with Badoni] We were just trying to build a partnership. He got off to a flyer, was hitting some nice shots and he&#39;s a very talented player. We were just trying to keep building on that and that was our only focus. I do enjoy the responsibility of batting a bit lower and seeing the game home. Part of my journey is batting at every position. Bowl the first over, bowl the last over. I&#39;m happy to do whatever my team needs. I think I was swinging a few in the nets the other day so the bowling coach got a bit excited and thought maybe start me with the new ball. The home wicket suits me a bit more taking the pace off and being creative. Nobody likes bowling on a flat wicket.&quot;</p> <p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=poochi&amp;subject=Bot%20Feedback"><sup>Send feedback</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_schedule"><sup>Schedule</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_help"><sup>Stat Help</sup></a></p> <p><sup>Please don&#39;t post illegal streaming links in match threads</sup></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CricketMatchBot"> /u/CricketMatchBot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/132510v/post_match_thread_lucknow_super_giants_vs_punjab/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/132510v/post_match_thread_lucknow_super_giants_vs_punjab/">[comments]</a></span>
