*   In the near future, cars will not only <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-cars-surveillance-national-security/">collect information</a> about their
   driver and passengers, but the vehicles, pedestrians, and city around
   them.*  <em>Unless we stop them!</em>
<p>
The reliable way to prevent this is to make it illegal for cars to
save, or transmit, <em>anything</em> that they see in images from the car's
cameras, <em>anything</em> that their microphones hear, and <em>anything</em> else
that their sensors collect.
<p>
This will demonstrate to the public that they don't need to fear the
presence of today's cars on our streets.
