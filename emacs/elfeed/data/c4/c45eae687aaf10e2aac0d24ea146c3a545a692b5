The UK <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#plutocratist">plutocratists</a> keep opposing nationalization of the railroads
because their funders, the rich, make money from the privatized
railroads.  So they don't want to admit that the previous state-owned
British Rail <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/11/railway-nationalisation-transpennine-express-conservatives">worked better than the subsequent state-owned railroads</a>.
<p>
Sad to say, the Tory Party is not the only <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#plutocratist">plutocratist</a> party in
Britain.  The Labour Party's support for renationalization is
half-hearted because Starmer is a <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#plutocratist">plutocratist</a> at heart.
Now that he has <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2023-mar-jun.html#5_May_2023_(Starmer's_Labour_betrayals)">blocked firm opponents of plutocratism
    from running as Labour candidates</a> for Parliament,
  it will be hard for Labour to get any better in the future.

When people assert that private capital can more easily invest the
large sums needed to improve railroads, the response is to ask why the
state doesn't have enough funds to invest.  Is it because of <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2016-may-aug.html#21_June_2016_(Growing_case_for_massive_taxes_on_rich)">reducing
    taxes on the rich and on businesses</a>?
             That's the real problem.
