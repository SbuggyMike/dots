US citizens: call on Congress to <a href="https://act.freepress.net/sign/fourth_amendment_not_for_sale_act?akid=23323.9489429.5k-CZF&rd=1&t=1002">pass the Fourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act</a>.
<p>
The Department of Hostility and Suffering currently <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/new-records-detail-dhs-purchase-and-use-of-vast-quantities-of-cell-phone-location-data">buys lots of surveillance data</a>. This law would prohibit that, but it wouldn't eliminate the resulting
injustice.  It is a small step forward, but not a true solution.
<p>
Governments could buy other kinds of data which would enable them to
find out what sort of places you have been, and then use parallel
construction to attack you.

<p>The Capitol Switchboard number is <a href="tel:+12022243121">+1-202-224-3121</a>.</p>
<p>If you call, please spread the word!</p>
