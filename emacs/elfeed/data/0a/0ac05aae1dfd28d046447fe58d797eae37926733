<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there anything I can put into <code>early-init.el</code> that suppress that white screen that appears before the actual theme loads? I&#39;m using the gruvbox theme which is not part of Emacs so calling it from <code>early-init.el</code> probably doesn&#39;t make sense on a fresh Emacs install. I was thinking maybe it is possible to change that white to a dark color at least.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zoliky"> /u/zoliky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb420w/how_to_suppress_the_white_screen_when_emacs_starts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb420w/how_to_suppress_the_white_screen_when_emacs_starts/">[comments]</a></span>
