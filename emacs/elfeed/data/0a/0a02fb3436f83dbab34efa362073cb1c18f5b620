Ukraine is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/16/no-jobs-no-homes-ukrainians-forced-back-to-frontline-towns">failing to arrange places to stay</a>, and essential support,

I've been wondering why so many people remain in Ukrainian towns where
they could be killed or maimed by shelling, and where they may be
captured by the <a href="/glossary.html#putinforces">Putin forces</a> and tortured, executed, or kidnapped and
taken to Russia.  Perhaps it is because they have no place to flee to
and survive.
