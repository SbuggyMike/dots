The "pervasive design" addictive features that the article naively
attributes to "screens" are implemented by software: partly in the
operating system and partly in some apps.  They can be designed to do
nasty things because they are <a href="fsf.org/tedx">non-free software</a>:
  their code is controlled by some "owner", in this case a powerful
company, rather than by the users.  If they were free programs, the
user community could reprogram them so as to be less addictive.
<p>
We must free ourselves from the idea that giant companies have the "right"
to require users' connection to their "services" to go through software
under their control.  We should have the right to use our free software
to do that.
