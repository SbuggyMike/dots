Was not a good wicket to start on but once set, you got the pace of the wicket and you realised what kind of shots you can play. [On the finisher&#39;s role] I have been enjoying it a lot. it is a very interesting role. It is not something that you can be very consistent with but on the days, you cane make an impact on the team. You need the backing of the captain and coach and I have got that in abundance. [Things to do to be successful in finishing off the innings] Assessing of the wicket is important. On any given day, the last three-four overs that you bat, you need to be aware of a lot of things such as the shape of the ball, the softness of the ball, the wicket, and then you need to decide These are a little bit of things and that comes with a little bit of practice.</p> <p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=poochi&amp;subject=Bot%20Feedback"><sup>Send feedback</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_schedule"><sup>Schedule</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_help"><sup>Stat Help</sup></a></p> <p><sup>Please don&#39;t post illegal streaming links in match threads</sup></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CricketMatchBot"> /u/CricketMatchBot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wbbpl8/post_match_thread_india_vs_west_indies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wbbpl8/post_match_thread_india_vs_west_indies/">[comments]</a></span>
