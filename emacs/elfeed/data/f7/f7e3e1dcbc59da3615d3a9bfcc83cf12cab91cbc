US citizens: phone your senators to oppose the "EARN-IT" bill that
would prohibit end-to-end encryption and require most online services
to scan, for the government, all material they get from users.
<p>
That's what Congress is considering
<a href="https://www.eff.org/pl/deeplinks/2022/02/its-back-senators-want-earn-it-bill-scan-all-online-messages">once again, after it was shelved</a>
for public opposition in 2020.  Now they are trying to rush it.
<p>
I think this would require services to require users to run nonfree
software in order to use them.
<p>
The bill is so extreme that if people communicate through an encrypted
service, and then commit a crime, that would be grounds to prosecute
the service.  Why go off the deep end?  I speculate that they figure
to drop them (as a "compromise") while keeping the basic outrages.
<p>
I found a campaign to contact senators to oppose this bill, but I
can't use it or recommend it, because it requires running nonfree
Javascript code.  Web sites and services should be usable with
Javascript disabled.
<p>
Why not make an exception and run the nonfree software "for a good
cause"?  Because once you make that kind of exception, once you allow
a pervasive injustice to become part of how you fight other
injustices, you've effectively legitimized that one.
<p>
Those web sites could have been designed to function even with Javascript
disabled, and they should be.
