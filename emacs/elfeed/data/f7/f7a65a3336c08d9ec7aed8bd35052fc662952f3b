<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I run Arch kernel linux-lts, i3wm. Suspend and hibernate work flawlessly. The problem is that after a succesful hibernation (computer shutdown after saving stuff to swap), if I just open the lid, the laptop will automatically power on. Is there a way to configure so that lid open will not power on the laptop? This only happens when I hibernate. If I shutdown, opening the lid does nothing =&gt; I have to physically press the power button.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maxle0312"> /u/maxle0312 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1326zk2/is_there_a_way_to_configure_lid_open_action_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1326zk2/is_there_a_way_to_configure_lid_open_action_for/">[comments]</a></span>
