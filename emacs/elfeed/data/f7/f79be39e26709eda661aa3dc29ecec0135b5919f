<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m starting a new video series of mine called Analysis from the Arranger&#39;s Perspective that talks about how I go about arranging pieces, why I find some composers easier to arrange than others, and shows the arrangement itself. I&#39;m still unsure as to whether or not multi-movement works like sonatas should be all in one video or separate videos for separate movements or if it should be either depending on the length of the piece(so short sonata like K 545, all in one video, long sonata like Appassionata, separate videos, that sort of thing).</p> <p>I&#39;m starting the series with a Mozart video for 2 reasons. First is just that I love Mozart. And second is that I find Mozart so easy for me to arrange for just about any ensemble. Reducing a symphony down to string quartet? You betcha I could do that with Mozart. Reducing a concerto down to piano solo? Yes. Expanding a piano sonata to string quartet? Yes. Expanding a string quartet to orchestra? Yes. All those and more I find easier to do with Mozart than just about any other composer. Only Haydn do I find it easier to do some of these for, like the symphony reductions. I also find that I often have to add to rather than subtract from Mozart&#39;s material, even in reductions(usually in reductions, it&#39;s just adding rhythmic activity to long notes by turning them into Alberti Bass or something similar, whereas in expansions, it&#39;s more along the lines of harmonization/countermelody addition).</p> <p>However, I need to narrow down my choices. So I made a poll to help me decide on which genre to focus on for deciding on the piece for my first video. I will undoubtedly do more than 1 Mozart video in the series, but for now, I want to do a first video for multiple composers, so like a Mozart video, Beethoven video, Bach video etc. before going back to Mozart.</p> <p>The poll ends in 2 weeks.
