<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Anyone happen to use <code>minimap-mode</code> (elpa)? I thought I&#39;d give it a shot and it seems nice. But when I, i.e. <code>split-window-right</code> I find that the two vertical panes are not distributed evenly across the frame minus the minimap window. How would I approach fixing this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jkdufair"> /u/jkdufair </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfdb20/minimap_and_splitting_windows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfdb20/minimap_and_splitting_windows/">[comments]</a></span>
