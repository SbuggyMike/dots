The sex of a baby sea turtle is determined by temperature.
This must have been an effectively random choice in the past,
but now that it is so hot, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/florida-turtles-born-female-climate-change/index.html">all the loggerhead sea turtles hatching
in Florida are female</a>.

In a few decades, that will cause extinction of the species &mdash; the females
will have no mates.
