<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>[note that I am new to arch linux (a noob) and thus may appear to be a monkey]</p> <p>I recently installed arch onto my PC, upon the install everything had been working perfectly (Nvidia, xorg, bspwm, arandr). Thinking everything was great I shutdown (with shutdown command) and went to sleep. Next morning boot up PC and recieved an error message quickly pop up and disappear, continuing I was unable to startx and recieved a fatal error. </p> <p>boot error: &quot;Failed to start NVIDIA Persistence Daemon&quot;</p> <p>Xorg log: <a href="HTTPS://transfer.sh/GHEz2h/xorg.txt">HTTPS://transfer.sh/GHEz2h/xorg.txt</a></p> <p>the command &quot;Sudo systemctl status nvidia-peristenced&quot; returned some failures I will write them here rather than writing the whole log: &quot;(red x failure symbol) nvidia-persistenced.service -in NVIDIA Persistence Daemon&quot; &quot;Failed to query NVIDIA devices. please ensure that the NVIDIA device files (/dev/nvidia*) exist, and that user 143 has read and write permissions for those files.&quot; &quot;nvidia-peristenced.service: Control process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE&quot; &quot;nvidia-persistenced.service: Failed with result &#39;exit-code&#39;.&quot; &quot;Failed to start NVIDIA Persistence Daemon.&quot;</p> <p>PC specs - Not in a VM - GTX 1060 3gb - Intel i5 - 8gb memory</p> <p>Earlier attempts at fixing: - reinstalling &quot;nvidia&quot; &quot;nvidia-utils&quot; through pacman - installing &quot;nvidia-settings&quot; - inserting &quot;Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier &quot;NVIDIA Card&quot; Driver &quot;nvidia&quot; VendorName &quot;NVIDIA Corporation&quot; BoardName &quot;GeForce GTX 1060&quot; EndSection&quot; to &quot;/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf&quot; - inserting &quot;MODULES=(nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)&quot; to &quot;/etc/mkinitcpio.conf&quot; then running &quot;sudo mkinitcpio -p linux&quot;</p> <ul> <li>rebooting several times</li> </ul> <p>If anyone knows how to fix this, please share, this is causing pain in 4D. Anyhow, thanks for reading this far - have a good day.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KateBinTM"> /u/KateBinTM </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w00lm7/startx_failing_cant_find_displays_help_requested/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w00lm7/startx_failing_cant_find_displays_help_requested/">[comments]</a></span>
