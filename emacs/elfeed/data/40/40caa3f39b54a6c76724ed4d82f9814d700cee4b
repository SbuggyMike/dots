<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I’m relatively new to the Linux OS’s. Running a Debian server since a little over a year, and my laptop runs on Ubuntu and W10. Though I’m using windows lesser and lesser there still are a few software packages that keep me there, and probably will for a long time coming. </p> <p>So here’s my question. In the past I had another laptop running multiboot, and I had burg installed as (graphic) boot loader. At the time that was a rather buggy app, and not even being maintained anymore. So 6 years later I think I might skip this one and try to find something else. Can anyone here hand me some suggestions in what I could use? It should be a graphic, because else there’s no reason not to use grub. And an easy install and setup would be nice as well. </p> <p>The hardware is a HP Elitebook 850 G3.</p> <p>Thanks a lot guys.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/doeffgek"> /u/doeffgek </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wgmpnm/grub_alternatives/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wgmpnm/grub_alternatives/">[comments]</a></span>
