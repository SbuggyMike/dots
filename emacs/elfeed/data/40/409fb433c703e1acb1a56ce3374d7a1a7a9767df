<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After updating and then rebooting one day my computer started hanging while booting after it finishes all of the file system checks. I tried going into an installation media, updating the system, mkinitcpio and redoing grub. I tried Control-C during the file system check. I tried changing TTYS. Some system details: encrypted lvm (as stated gets past the decryption part), nvidia, boots to console no log in manager or window manager.</p> <p>I would appreciate any suggestions!</p> <p>UPDATE: Booted with nomodeset. Trying to find out what to do with this information now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lowmoya"> /u/lowmoya </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wjt8yl/arch_boot_gets_stuck_after_file_system_check/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wjt8yl/arch_boot_gets_stuck_after_file_system_check/">[comments]</a></span>
