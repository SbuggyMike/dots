<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, freeradius is great. We use to auth over 100k+ devices. However, now that we&#39;re looking toward the future and some different integration into our OSS/BSS systems, I&#39;m trying to find something that allows a little bit more.</p> <p>For example, if a client sends MS-Chapv2, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any good way of bypassing freeRADIUS itself from handling the NTLM pieces.</p> <p>FreeRADIUS&#39;s REST module is half baked, not to mentioned not really documented.</p> <p>....there&#39;s no way that this is still the only viable RADIUS server implementation, is it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/s-parikh"> /u/s-parikh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wjk877/is_freeradius_really_the_only_oss_radius_server/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wjk877/is_freeradius_really_the_only_oss_radius_server/">[comments]</a></span>
