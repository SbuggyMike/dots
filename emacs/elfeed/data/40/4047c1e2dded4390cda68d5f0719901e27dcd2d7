<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been over 3 months since our last beginner questions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/10ampfk/the_qa_megathread_for_new_and_beginner_chess/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">megathread</a> and since it was quite popular and educational last time we have decided to create a new one. This post is for beginners to ask questions without having to make separate posts for them. Remember that everyone was once a beginner and had to start from the start at some point. </p> <p>Let us know if this is something you would like to continue seeing in the future. Keep in mind that we are limited to only two subreddit pins so any beginner megathread will have to be taken down when there are important events taking place. </p> <p>We also recommend that for more specific advice, you check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chessbeginners">r/chessbeginners</a>. If you are into chess memes and humour, or you are wondering what that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7lZilVy04">weird pawn move glitch is,</a> then all the good people at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchychess">r/anarchychess</a> will surely help you out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Liquid_Plasma"> /u/Liquid_Plasma </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/12rkts1/the_qa_megathread_for_new_and_beginner_chess/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/12rkts1/the_qa_megathread_for_new_and_beginner_chess/">[comments]</a></span>
