<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently working on transferring my dotfiles to a public repository on github, as Linux users often do. I&#39;m doing it mostly for redundancy and personal ease of use, of course, but I still want to make sure that other people are free to copy my files and/or take inspiration from them as they create their own. That means I need a license of some sort.</p> <p>However, choosing a license for a dotfiles repository doesn&#39;t seem quite as cut-and-dry as choosing a license for a program of my own design. These files aren&#39;t exactly my personal creation; I mean, they were written by me, but they&#39;re essentially just a set of options being passed to their respective programs. It doesn&#39;t quite feel fair to the developers of Alacritty, for instance, for me to say &quot;Alacritty I want you to use this hex for the color blue&quot; and then turn around and distribute that as if it were my own work.</p> <p>During my research I&#39;ve found examples of a few different kinds of licenses in random people&#39;s repositories, but so far I&#39;ve been unable to find any articles, guides, or even discussions on the subject. So: what is the accepted practice for choosing a license for a dotfiles repository?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FoxesArePrettyCoolYo"> /u/FoxesArePrettyCoolYo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w255k7/what_sort_of_license_should_i_use_for_my_public/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w255k7/what_sort_of_license_should_i_use_for_my_public/">[comments]</a></span>
