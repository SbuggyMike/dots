<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new.</p> <p>Been doing lots of puzzles &amp; having fun playing games.</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to learn just a couple openings.</p> <p>My general impression of chess youtubers/instructors is that they take their own knowledge for granted &amp; overestimate how much new players will be able to understand.</p> <p>It often feels like: &quot;Okay, let&#39;s learn the Caro-Kann! If you go b4 to g8 to c3 to h1 but they go c2 to g3 to n7 to z20 to w874 to q56 all you have to do is go red57 to green74 and then go 7-11 and you gottem. On the other hand...&quot;</p> <p>Like bruh, I&#39;ve lost the train of thought 3 moves into the explanation.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for someone who explains the <em>general ideas</em> of openings. What&#39;s the theme of an opening? What are the important pieces and why? What are the common positions I can expect to see? Where &amp; when will I usually castle?</p> <p>That kind of thing.</p> <p>Do y&#39;all know any good YouTubers/streamers/etc. to follow who dumb stuff down this drastically?</p> <p>Or maybe some resources on <em>how</em> to get better at learning/following/studying openings?</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> thanks so much for these recommendations, guys; wonderful community here :*-)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SgtSprinkle"> /u/SgtSprinkle </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbaxqp/any_youtubersstreamers_out_there_who_focus_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbaxqp/any_youtubersstreamers_out_there_who_focus_on/">[comments]</a></span>
