Two years ago, Belarus forced down an airliner crossing its territory
so as to seize dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich and his (then?
former?) girlfriend, Sofia Sapega.  Now Lukashenko has tentatively
decided to keep him
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/03/belarus-sentences-journalist-raman-pratasevich-to-eight-years-in-jail">in prison for 8 years for the crime of journalism</a>.

There is no reason to suppose Lukashenko would actually release him, 8
years from now.  It might do to him what Israel has done to Mordechai
Vanunu &mdash; keeping him effectively <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2010-jan-apr.html#02%20January%202010%20(Mordechai%20Vanunu)">incommunicado indefinitely</a>,
and pretending it is has a purpose other than making him suffer.

Sapega was sentenced to 6 years in prison.
