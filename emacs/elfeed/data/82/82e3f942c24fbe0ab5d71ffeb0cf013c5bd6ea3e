<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I updated my brew packages yesterday, thereby inadvertently updating Emacs to version 28, which proved incompatible with my v26 configuration.</p> <p>Emacs started up in an unusable state, with multiple errors.</p> <p>This brought my workflow to a grinding halt. I should really have a backup Textmind instance for such situations. (Maybe I do somewhere.)</p> <p>I googled how to downgrade the package in brew, but that appeared needlessly complicated. Brew did not have alternative versions of Emacs.</p> <p>Instead I downloaded Emacs 26.3 from <a href="https://emacsformacosx.com/builds/all">Emacs for Macos X</a>. I installed it as Emacs 3 (and Emacs 27 as Emacs 2).</p> <p>I ran Emacs 3, and everything worked fine. Now I can upgrade my configuration at my leisure, and my workflow is uninterrupted.</p> <p>My googling didn&#39;t highlight this easy answer, causing me to waste time doing questionable things at the Terminal.</p> <p>I have a complicated setup with Chemacs profiles etc, and it somewhat surprised me when everything just worked. That&#39;s why I use MacOS.</p> <p>Best practices are good, but fast food is forever!</p> <p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-why-mcdonalds-burgers-never-rot">Here&#39;s Why McDonald&#39;s Burgers Don&#39;t Rot | The Food Lab</a></p> <p>Edit: There was a voice in my head telling me this post was too stupid and obvious to write, and now I&#39;m glad I ignored it.
