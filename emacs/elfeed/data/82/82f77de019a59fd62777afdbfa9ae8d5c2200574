A medically-necessary emergency abortion provides an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/16/cost-of-abortion-us-expense">example of

This is why I advocate a national medical system, not merely "Medicare
for all."  Under Medicare, medical treatment can be quite expensive.
Even the part the patient has to pay can be quite expensive.
