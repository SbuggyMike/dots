Right-wingers and <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> in Germany demand to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/27/german-police-call-for-tougher-response-to-growing-climate-protests-letzte-generation">imprison people for a
month</a>
if they are suspected of planning annoying protests, such as blocking roads.
<p>
The protesters demand cutting greenhouse emissions faster, on the grounds
that climate collapse is likely to kill them before they get old.
<p>
The <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> want to "get the situation under control" to assure an orderly
march towards mass death.  Orderly, that is, until it is too late to
prevent collapse and the early death of most of these potential protesters
is assured.
<p>
Climate disaster is likely to kill billions of people.  It will not be
an accident, though; big businesses of various kinds are lobbying to
keep it going while they extract all possible money.  (Those who
profit suppose that they will be somehow safe from the disaster,
though I don't see how that could be true.)
<p>
As a consequence, we can describe future climate disaster as the
biggest act of mass murder of all human history, past and future.  It
is unlikely that there will ever again be billions of people to kill.
