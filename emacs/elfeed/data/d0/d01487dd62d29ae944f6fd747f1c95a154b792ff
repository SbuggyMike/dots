<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(OF COURSE this is not directed exclusively to violinists. All of us music enthusiasts tend to have an opinion on this matter, all are welcome here). I&#39;m more of a Guarnerius person myself. Personally, I think Sarah Chang&#39;s Del Ges√∫ might be my favorite timbre. But I get that it may be too &quot;earthy&quot; for some... I love the clarity of most Strads too, the one Janine Jansen currently plays stands out to me. I really love the darker tones of an Amatius too, btw.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Eraserend"> /u/Eraserend </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8tigr/hey_violin_gang_strad_or_guarnerius_which_do_you/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8tigr/hey_violin_gang_strad_or_guarnerius_which_do_you/">[comments]</a></span>
