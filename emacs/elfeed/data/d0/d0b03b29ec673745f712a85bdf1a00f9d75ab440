<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since yesterday, my Arch machine takes more than 3 minutes to boot, when it usually booted in under 20 seconds. The system still boots fine, but it gets stuck for most of the boot process in &quot;A start job is running for Wait for udev To Complete Device Initialization (58s 2min 59s)&quot;, which then fails and the boot process finishes and the login screen pops up.</p> <p>Screenshots: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MonkeEnthusiast8420/comments/vyx3p1/screenshots/">https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MonkeEnthusiast8420/comments/vyx3p1/screenshots/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MonkeEnthusiast8420"> /u/MonkeEnthusiast8420 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyx571/arch_takes_way_longer_than_normal_to_boot/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyx571/arch_takes_way_longer_than_normal_to_boot/">[comments]</a></span>
