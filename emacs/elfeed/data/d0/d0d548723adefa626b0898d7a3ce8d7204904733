<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have have a laptop with Optimus graphics including Intel HD Graphics 610 and NVidia MX110. I use <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager">optimus-manager</a> to switch between them when I need to. Everything works pretty fine except one thing.</p> <p>OpenGL works fine in Wine on both Intel and NVidia GPUs when using Mesa. But I have installed lib32-nvidia-utils to use proprietary NVidia driver in Wine for OpenGL apps and it also works fine when running on NVidia GPU. However, when I switch to Intel, Wine doesn&#39;t want to run GUI applications at all and says this:</p> <p><code>nodrv_createwindow application tried to create a window, but no driver could be loaded.</code></p> <p>When I uninstall lib32-nvidia-utils, Wine and OpenGL works again on both GPUs. So is there a way to use proprietary NVidia driver in Wine without breaking things for Intel GPU?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheNightSkyDude"> /u/TheNightSkyDude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzt1gz/optimus_wine_cant_run_wine_on_integrated_gpu_when/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzt1gz/optimus_wine_cant_run_wine_on_integrated_gpu_when/">[comments]</a></span>
