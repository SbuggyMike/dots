<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay so, I have attempted to install Arch Linux onto my Live USB via belena etcher, I downloaded directly from Https and I do have the ISO image and signature, however, when I attempt to flash it onto my USB drive, I am met with an error that reads:</p> <p>Command failed: cmd/c &quot;C:Users/AppData/local/temp/etcher/balena etcher-electron-25b04127c174.cmd&quot;</p> <p>Internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:890 Throw err; ^ Error: Cannot find module</p> <p>I also attempted to format my USB drive to delete previous data but it also displays an error and just says its not able to format it.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve did, I simply followed the instructions, perhaps I chose the wrong mirror? It seems right to me, &quot;archlinux...86_64.iso&quot; and I&#39;m almost 100% that my system supports 64 bit, its a 2006 Thinkpad T60 with Intel Core Duo 2. </p> <p>Anyone have any solutions? Idk what I&#39;ve did wrong here :(</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ian_077"> /u/Ian_077 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0wjje/arch_linux_live_usb_installation_module_error/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0wjje/arch_linux_live_usb_installation_module_error/">[comments]</a></span>
