I am really looking forward to this tournament for two reasons:</p> <ol> <li><p>The youngsters playing here. Gukesh has 6 more classical games here and he has overtaken Abdusattorov in live ratings after the first win. A great tournament here and Gukesh can officially enter the top 15 for the first time ever. </p></li> <li><p>Get to see Gelfand and Svidler once again!</p></li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/glancesurreal"> /u/glancesurreal </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/44zfalv8r0ya1.png">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/138fsdb/tepe_sigeman_and_co_chess_tournament_after_round_1/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
