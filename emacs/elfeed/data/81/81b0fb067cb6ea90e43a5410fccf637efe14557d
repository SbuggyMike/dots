Nf3 g6) allows white to go for the rather harmonious 3. c3 4. d4 setup in addition to the direct 3. d4 and black is always a bit worse. In the Accelerated Dragon ( 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 ) but White is now able to go for the restricting and suffocating Maroczy Bind with 5. c4 which is very very pleasant for White. Not to mention, any Sicilian move orders involving 2...Nc6 means you have to deal with White playing 3. Bb5, the Rossolimo, which is super complicated and makes the game very positional, it&#39;s one of the best weapons against Nc6 Sicilians at the highest levels and Magnus Carlsen also plays it a lot. Of course, the traditional Dragon runs into the challenging Yugoslav Attack, although it&#39;s not as simple as Fischer once said ( &quot;sac sac mate lmao&quot; ), it is still very dangerous.</p> <p>There isn&#39;t a direct solution to any of the problems but recently I encountered a super obscure move order trick and I fell right into it. First, let&#39;s look at one of the positions from main line Sicilian Dragon, Yugoslav Attack (without Bc4). The line goes like this: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/kl12o9vadje91.jpg?width=1376&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272cbb2b9660a30d70965f3980f1550badec9d2d">https://preview.redd.it/kl12o9vadje91.jpg?width=1376&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272cbb2b9660a30d70965f3980f1550badec9d2d</a></p> <p>Here 9...d5 is the absolute main move and you can see, Black appears to have wasted a tempo on ...d6 and then ...d5, but d5 is such a strong move that you waste a tempo and you still have to play it. d6 was necessary to prevent Nxc6 and e5 shenanigans attacking the f6-Knight and this applies to a lot of the sicilians ( there are exceptions, e.g. when Black can simply punish White via Qa5+ winning the e5-pawn in certain positions. )</p> <p>Then, I encountered this obscure move order. 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6?! Usually people play 5...e5 ( Sveshnikov ), 5...d6 ( Classical Sicilian ) or 5...e6 ( 4-Knights ), here my opponent tried 5...g6?!</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/8ncjoeksdje91.jpg?width=1374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee2aa7772755923b42053632e03ec0e2f58ee377">Strange move order.</a></p> <p>I initially didn&#39;t pay too much attention to the move order and tried to use the Yugoslav attack setup because that usually works against Dragon setups ( i.e. Be3, f3, Qd2 and O-O-O followed by pawn storm ) but here I got splashed by a cold bucket of water when I reached the following position.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/mvy8c6khdje91.jpg?width=1379&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9dba788f30d4d339e03aff3f40afed573b3badf">https://preview.redd.it/mvy8c6khdje91.jpg?width=1379&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9dba788f30d4d339e03aff3f40afed573b3badf</a></p> <p>Before I even get to castle, my opponent hits me with the direct 8...d5! This is when I realized, oh I&#39;m in serious trouble. He saved one tempo by skipping ...d6 entirely and now he is just a move ahead, this is literally the traditional Dragon on steroids for Black. I proceeded to get absolutely destroyed.</p> <p>My first reaction was, &quot;wow, this move order is crazy good for Black, he straight up skipped d6 and hit me with d5 directly? Bruh...&quot; then I did a little bit of research and engine analysis reveals why that move order is bad. Remember why people play ...d6 in a lot of the Sicilian variations? Apparently the simple refutation to 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6?! is simply <strong>6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. e5</strong>. That&#39;s pretty much it. You exploit the fact that Black hasn&#39;t played d6 to stop e5 and forcefully get e5 through and White is almost winning out of the opening with a super high win rate for White in the database. So yeah. </p> <p>TL;DR: Don&#39;t blindly play the Yugoslav setup against Dragon setups. Got tricked and transposed into a line in Accelerated Dragon (which I didn’t know because I exclusively play Maroczy against Accelerated Dragon) and got demolished, turns out there’s a simple refutation to this move order (which I think the main purpose is to avoid Maroczy Bind since White has committed to Nc3).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheThinker4Head"> /u/TheThinker4Head </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wb9n1v/obscure_move_order_trick_in_the_sicilian_dragon/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wb9n1v/obscure_move_order_trick_in_the_sicilian_dragon/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
