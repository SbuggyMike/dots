<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am really interested in finding some of the most sad, painful, and melancholic pieces out there, especially ones that don’t get enough credit. I am tired of searching for these kinds of pieces and seeing the same Lacrimosa and Serenade. I’ll start by suggesting the 2nd movement of the bach/casadesus viola concerto in c minor. While not completely unknown, I believe it doesn’t get enough credit. This piece reads so remorseful and miserable while also being so beautiful. Love it so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PeaUpper2782"> /u/PeaUpper2782 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wezlmi/obscure_painfulmelancholic_piece_suggestions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wezlmi/obscure_painfulmelancholic_piece_suggestions/">[comments]</a></span>
