<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, i moved to a new laptop. Did a fresh install and my same speakers i used with my old one always do a crackle or pop whenever a video or music starts/stops in youtube or vlc or if i start or start my laptop. This did not happen in my old set up and i am not sure why. The packages are identical but maybe there is a config differences. I was trying to look it up and some people in Ubuntu forums talking about power saving and the speakers go into sleep when not in use i do not quite understand. They were talking about some alsamix change but i do not have that (alsamixer -c0). I use pipewire btw All packages are updated. This crackle or pop is driving me crazy. Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pyboy2022"> /u/pyboy2022 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyx884/new_laptop_and_popping_noise_with_external/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyx884/new_laptop_and_popping_noise_with_external/">[comments]</a></span>
