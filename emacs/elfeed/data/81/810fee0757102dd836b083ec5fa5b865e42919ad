<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been using arch for the better part of 8 years. I have a system that&#39;s never had a problem until now. Never thought I&#39;d be the one asking a question here, but I have a real head-scratcher. </p> <p>My System76 Thelio suddenly started refusing to boot today. </p> <p>When I hop into the grub settings and set load_modules=off, it boots up just fine.</p> <p>So I try using log_level=7 to see if I can get any useful messages about what module might be causing issues, and instead, the system boots just fine. </p> <p>So I try a regular reboot, and it&#39;s still not booting.</p> <p>Hard reset, go to grub, hit <code>e</code> on the default entry, and then hit Ctrl+x without making any changes and...it boots. Why?</p> <p>I thought maybe there was a screwup with the latest grub generation so I ran <code>pacman -Syu linux</code> to force a reinstall (and regenerate my boot image and config) but that didn&#39;t help. I still need to edit my cmdline params in grub to finish boot. </p> <p>Again, I don&#39;t make any edits and it works, but I do need to hit edit first. </p> <p>Has anyone else experienced this? Any ideas what could be causing it?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WaRPTuX"> /u/WaRPTuX </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wd5mqa/cant_boot_without_editing_grub_command_line/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wd5mqa/cant_boot_without_editing_grub_command_line/">[comments]</a></span>
