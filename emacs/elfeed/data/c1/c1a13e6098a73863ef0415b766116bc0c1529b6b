A New Zealand company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/19/glassdoor-ordered-to-reveal-identity-of-negative-reviewers-to-new-zealand-toymaker">sued a US web service</a> demanding it identify the people who posted harsh reviews of the company as an employer.  The US
court decided the case based on New Zealand's laws, which don't
protect free speech as the US does.

The weakness of protection of freedom of speech outside the US is one
of the main reasons I have been reluctant to live outside the US.  The
other countries are not getting better, not at all, but the Christian
Taliban threaten to make the US far, far worse.
