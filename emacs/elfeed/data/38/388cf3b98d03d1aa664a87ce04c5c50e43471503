<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s stupid to make a thread about this, but I just find this to be such a sketchy practice. To unsubscribe from my premium chess24 subscription, it&#39;s telling me I have to email support rather than just having a button to click. Usually this UX is reserved for shady websites purposely making it a pain to unsubscribe, so I&#39;m really disappointed chess24 has resorted to this tactic.</p> <p>I think I just wanted to raise awareness to this so that somehow maybe they&#39;d feel some pressure to be more customer friendly. I will 10000% refuse to resubscribe in the future (when I&#39;m more active with chess) because of this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/carcwut"> /u/carcwut </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wh5oee/sketchy_ux_chess24_requires_email_for_sub/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wh5oee/sketchy_ux_chess24_requires_email_for_sub/">[comments]</a></span>
