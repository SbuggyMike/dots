<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the last year I&#39;ve started using emacs at work. The language I end up using most is php with the Laravel framework. Laravel implemented a php repl called Tinker that loads the laravel framework and allows the user to interact with it. Where would I begin if I wanted to integrate the same thing with emacs? I know SLIME, et. al. is impossible without a major php rewrite but I&#39;d like to get as close as possible. I don&#39;t want just a repl but a buffer where I can send files or selected code to the repl and receive the output in the repl buffer. Is there a good plugin I could maybe learn from in order to write it or does anyone know of one already that I haven&#39;t been able to find?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/joshuacottrell"> /u/joshuacottrell </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jnq4k/php_with_laravel_in_emacs_tinker_integration/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jnq4k/php_with_laravel_in_emacs_tinker_integration/">[comments]</a></span>
