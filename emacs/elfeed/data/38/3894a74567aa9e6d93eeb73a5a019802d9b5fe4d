<p>Pavel Korytov is a fairly new Emacs user. He’s been at it for about two and half years but as seasoned Emacs users know, the learning never ends and even those of us with 15 or more years in are still in the learning phase.</p>
<p>He’s got an interesting post, <a href="https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2023-04-13-emacs/">916 days of Emacs</a>, that looks at how he spent his time in Emacs. He uses <a href="https://activitywatch.net/">ActivityWatch</a> and <a href="https://wakatime.com/">WakaTime</a> to track his tube time so he has some pretty accurate statistics on the matter.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting post: his usage patterns are very different from mine. It’s especially nice to see his initial learning phase times. None of this makes any real difference, of course—it’s just an engaging peek into someone else’s Emacs use, and the beginning of their Emacs journey. Take a look if you’re interested in such things.</p>
