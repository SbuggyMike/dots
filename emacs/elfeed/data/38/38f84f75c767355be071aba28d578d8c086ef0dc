<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently on VIM and I have a big problem. I can&#39;t change the keyboard layout easily. HJKL to move around is great, I love it, they are aligned and side by side. When I switch to BÃ‰PO (the DVORAK keyboard layout of the French) I lose all my shortcuts. I can then write a lot of rammapage settings but they won&#39;t work from one program to another. And it&#39;s very frustrating, ugly, not functional with some plugins. I use VIM shortcuts on vscode, and other software. I want to stay flexible in case I change IDE in a company for example.<br/> Anyway, I don&#39;t dare to change my keyboard layout just because of vim.</p> <p>I wanted to know if Emacs was also a problem when changing the keyboard layout. </p> <p>PS: I recently bought a mechanical keyboard with layer keys (the Dygma Defy), so I&#39;m wondering about leaving vim even though I like it a lot</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/undev11"> /u/undev11 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf15po/shortcuts_and_changing_the_keyborard_layout/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf15po/shortcuts_and_changing_the_keyborard_layout/">[comments]</a></span>
