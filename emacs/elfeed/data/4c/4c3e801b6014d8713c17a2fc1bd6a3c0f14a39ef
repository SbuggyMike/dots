<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There has of course been a lot of focus on Firouzja and the young Indian prodigies lately, but I thought I&#39;d look into the highest-rated members of the younger generations for whom there&#39;s been relatively less focus.</p> <p>2007 and 2008: There seems to be relatively less outstanding talent here; the biggest name is probably French GM Marc-Andria Maurizzi (rated 2530) who is currently playing in the Olympiad.</p> <p>2009: Abhimanyu Mishra, the youngest GM ever (rated 2549) is presumably the strongest player from this birth year. Ukrainian FM Ihor Samunenkov (2454) also seems strong.</p> <p>2010: Andy Woodward (rated 2475), an American FM, appears strongest from this year- potential for becoming one of the youngest GMs ever? Czech FM Vaclav Finek (2397) is the second-highest-rated from this year, and notably has been in the high 2300s/low 2400s for nearly two years so could well have a breakout beyond that soon.</p> <p>2011: Turkish FM Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus (2456) looks very strong, having gained an incredible 501 rating points within the last year. As does Indian FM Rosh Jain (2380), who has gained 566 rating points in the last year! </p> <p>Beyond that I think it&#39;s too early to say. Any further thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/luna_sparkle"> /u/luna_sparkle </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/whynzg/who_are_the_most_promising_players_from_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/whynzg/who_are_the_most_promising_players_from_the/">[comments]</a></span>
