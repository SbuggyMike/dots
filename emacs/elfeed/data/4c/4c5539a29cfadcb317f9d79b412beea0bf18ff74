<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The success of Bangladesh especially can be attributed to the Asia Cup, which they played since the 80s, when they were nowhere close to the top associate. Unlike the other associates, Bangladesh played FMs regularly, even at home, which built the fanbase.</p> <p>If every other continent started a continental championship in the 80s, it would&#39;ve led to more FMs easily. Here&#39;s what continental competitions would&#39;ve looked like in the 90s</p> <p>Europe - 4 nations (England, Scotland, Ireland, Netherlands) Pacific - 3 nations (Australia, New Zealand, PNG) Americas - 3 nations (West Indies, Canada, USA) Africa - 3 nations (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya)</p> <p>In due course, when the associates become FMs as they improve, more qualification spots would be added (which is what the Asia Cup did)</p> <p>The other perk of continental competitions is that it gives more power to that continent in the ICC board. Bangladesh always voted with the Asian bloc because of the help that they got from Asian nations. That helped them host more tournaments etc.</p> <p>So, yeah, why on earth did other continents not follow the Asian model when it was the most logical thing to do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Huge-Physics5491"> /u/Huge-Physics5491 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w4fudt/why_didnt_other_continents_create_continental/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w4fudt/why_didnt_other_continents_create_continental/">[comments]</a></span>
