<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everybody. I just saw a Linux solution that I think is very unique and I wanted t share it.</p> <p>My school is full of macs but some of us still wants to use Linux (for development using Valgrind) and he made an Alpine docker image and a bash script that launches that, when docker is running, starts the Linux machine and automatically connects to it. The ingenious thin that I didn&#39;t think about is that it mounts the Mac home partition for itself, so it can fully interact with the files flawlessly. </p> <p>I find this hole think really cool, and I&#39;ll probably use it for development as well.<br/> Have you guys used /heard about this kind of setup, do you have any tips to make even better use of it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lacusch"> /u/Lacusch </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w28cjq/a_unique_way_to_use_linux_on_mac/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w28cjq/a_unique_way_to_use_linux_on_mac/">[comments]</a></span>
