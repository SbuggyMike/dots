<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am the maintainer of the schilytools, a set of tools (cdrtools, star, smake, sccs, ...) formerly developed by Jörg Schilling.</p> <p>After his passing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/qb94kt/continued_development_of_j%C3%B6rg_schillings_tools/">9 months ago</a> I have asked you to <a href="https://mlists.in-berlin.de/mailman/listinfo/schilytools-mlists.in-berlin.de">subscribe to our mailing list</a> if you are interested in continuing the development of the toolset.</p> <p>Since that announcement, we have rehosted the project on <a href="https://codeberg.org/schilytools/schilytools">codeberg.org</a> and started to work on some known bugs and new features. If you had previously reported bugs to Jörg Schilling that haven&#39;t been fixed, please report them again. I do not have access to his emails (yet) and do not know what bug reports there are.</p> <p>We are especially looking for help in the following areas:</p> <ul> <li>documentation rewrite and improvements (as a simple starting tasks, all documentation has to have Jörg&#39;s old contact information replaced with the new project home page)</li> <li>internationalisation and localisation (the groundwork has been partially laid, but lots of <code>gettext</code> calls need to be patched in and the build system expanded to deal with <code>.po</code> files)</li> <li>build testing on various platforms and architectures, continuous integration</li> <li>review and improvement of the existing code</li> <li>improved support for current macOS (where parts of the codebase are known not to link right now)</li> <li>if you are a maintainer of one of the projects bundled in the schilytools (such as cdrtools, mkisofs, smake, star, sccs, and ved), consider adding missing utilities and updating the existing ones to the latest version <a href="http://schilytools.sourceforge.net/">shipped on Sourceforge</a>. Many distributions still ship versions of the various components that precede their merge into the schilytools project</li> <li>if you are a maintainer of a distribution that does not ship schilytools, consider packaging them. If you need help, I can answer any questions you might have. You can check the opencsw files in the distribution for a suggested split into subpackages.</li> </ul> <p>If you would like to help with any of these or assist the project in other ways, please sign up to our mailing list. We accept patches as pull requests on the Codeberg site or through the mailing list in the old fashioned way. Do not hesitate to ask any questions you might have. I am happy to help you get started with the somewhat idiosyncratic design of the project.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FUZxxl"> /u/FUZxxl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w9vrpx/continued_development_of_jörg_schillings_tools/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w9vrpx/continued_development_of_jörg_schillings_tools/">[comments]</a></span>
