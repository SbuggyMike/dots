<p>Hey HN!<p>Alexis here, I’m a product manager and software developer in Berlin by way of New York.<p>I want to show you this app I made – It’s like a "buddy" for those, like myself, who inadvertedly talk too much in meetings.<p>The app gives me feedback and a little more in control of what I have influence over by:<p>* Keeping track of how long I’ve been speaking<p>* Catching myself before I talk too much<p>* Developing a better sense of timing<p>I truly love having conversations with people in real-life.<p>But online meetings, especially group calls, tend to make me nervous. I can't read body language. The tone of voice, micro-experessions and social cues get lost.<p>If you, too, accidentally talk too much too often, check it out "Unblah". Watch the quick 2-minute demo and download the macOS app over at <a href="https://unblah.me/" rel="nofollow">https://unblah.me/</a>.<p>Cheers!<p>Alexis<p>PS: There’s a whole FAQ section for common questions you may have – Including if this is yet another "native" Electron app ;)<p>edit: bullet-list formatting</p>
