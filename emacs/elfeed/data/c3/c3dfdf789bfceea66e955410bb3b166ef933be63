Democrats in the House of Representatives are trying to pass a bill
to <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/house-dems-discharge-petition-debt-limit">extend the debt ceiling and do nothing else</a>.
<p>
  They plan to do this using a <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-nov-feb.html#6_January_2023_(MAGA,_shutdown_the_US)">discharge petition</a>.
  To succeed, they need 5 Republicans to sign.  They believe they can
get them.
