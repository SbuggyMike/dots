<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m VERY new to chess. My first lesson with a coach gave me a puzzle to solve and I been trying to work it but I’ve been stuck because i think I’m overthinking it and keep causing a stalemate. I was wondering if there’s an app where I can plug in the position with pieces and have the computer work them out with me? As I’m writing this I’m thinking no but maybe? </p> <p>It’s probably a very easy puzzle I’ll give pieces and coordinates:</p> <p>Black king b8 White pawn b6 White pawn. b5 White king c6</p> <p>I keep coming up stalemate or a TON of moves to checkmate and I figured I’d work this out on an app versus a board as I’m frustrated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jchetra83"> /u/jchetra83 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wh7jkx/is_there_an_app_where_you_can_plug_in_a_position/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wh7jkx/is_there_an_app_where_you_can_plug_in_a_position/">[comments]</a></span>
