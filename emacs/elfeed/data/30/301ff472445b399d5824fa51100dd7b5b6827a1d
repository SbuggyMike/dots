<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know this doesn&#39;t seem relevant to Linux but it is and it&#39;s a serious problem in my opinion. As of late, I realize that Python in it&#39;s current state is just broken and shouldn&#39;t be used for writing any sophisticated programs (GUI programs and such) since it is prone to crash. Everytime Python is updated (even for minor updates) applications that depend on it often just fall apart and suddenly stop working. Not only that but tracing back where it crashed and how to fix it is a non-trivial task compared to when say, Qt/C++ programs crash (cause yes, occasionally they do have problems after some updates but it&#39;s not nearly as common of an issue as Python applications, this is just one example of course). Sometimes even updating those Python packages are non-trivial and prone to crash as well.</p> <p>Personally I find it irritating that people actually depend on a programming language that cannot be relied on, might as well develop Web Applications. They are bloated as heck but at least they <em>work</em> better, with Python, your one update away from your programs no longer working or even just updating python not working. I honestly don&#39;t even know how devs put up with that.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t wanna waste time trashing another programming language but Python continues to be a source of frustration for me and yet many applications use it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DrewTechs"> /u/DrewTechs </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vzt0i6/the_serious_issues_with_python/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vzt0i6/the_serious_issues_with_python/">[comments]</a></span>
