<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TITLE FIX: In elisp, how do I use consult to get the <strong>user&#39;s</strong> selection from a list of items?</p> <p>Suppose I have the following list:</p> <pre><code>(setq elements &#39;((&quot;apple&quot; &quot;fruit&quot;) (&quot;train&quot; &quot;vehicle&quot;) (&quot;cherry&quot; &quot;fruit&quot;) (&quot;bycicle&quot; &quot;vehicle&quot;))) </code></pre> <p>How do I use consult and all the completion goodies to get one of the entries of the elements list?</p> <p>I would like to be able to select based on the name of the entry, which would be the first element of the list. But I would like to get the list as the selection.</p> <p>Is it possible?</p> <p>Is there a better way to structure the entries of the elements list? Maybe something like this:</p> <pre><code>(:type &quot;vehicle&quot; :name &quot;train&quot;) </code></pre> <p>Sorry if this should be obvious, I am still learning elisp and I am struggling with it. I tried to read the code of the consult-buffer but I could not figure how is the plist SOURCE structured.</p> <p>SOLVED: completing-read function is the answer. There is a very nice guide here: <a href="https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/alt-completing-read.html">https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/alt-completing-read.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kamui78"> /u/kamui78 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132vvqm/in_elisp_how_do_i_use_consult_to_get_the_users/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132vvqm/in_elisp_how_do_i_use_consult_to_get_the_users/">[comments]</a></span>
