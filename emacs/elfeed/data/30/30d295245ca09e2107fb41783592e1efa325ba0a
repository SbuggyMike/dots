  Fascists in France <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/11/french-leaders-warn-of-toxic-rows-over-immigration-after-far-right-arson-attack">set fire to the cars and house</a> of a town mayor
who supported caring for immigrants.

The fascist strategy, in France as everywhere, is to demonstrate their
"courage" to attack those who can't defend themselves, in order to
make everyone afraid to disagree with them.  It is not easy to
thwart.  But I think it requires capturing and punishing some fascist
terrorists.
