<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>OK, I never have completely left but I have been trying other options and let me tell you - it is not better on the other side!</p> <p>I tried Helix - too limited for now.</p> <p>Neovim - not wanting to do things on my own, I tried pre-built configurations and nothing worked, even after having to upgrade to a PPA to get an up to date version.</p> <p>Kate - still too limited but getting there.</p> <p>VSCode - ok, this is my fallback for when I need something now and Emacs is not there. It could be my main driver but I don&#39;t like Microsoft &#39;s approach to open source and the fact that keybinds are not the same in Linux, Windows and Mac!</p> <p>I am using Spacemacs and it mostly works, I just have to work on getting some layout and behaviour the way I like it!</p> <p>It looks like I am getting to the point where Emacs will finally become my main (if not only!) editor. Quite a change for someone who has tried many, many times!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/g_tb"> /u/g_tb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13196x1/back_to_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13196x1/back_to_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
