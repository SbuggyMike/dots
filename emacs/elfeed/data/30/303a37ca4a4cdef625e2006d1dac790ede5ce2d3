<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to reduce idle power consumption of my GPU (30W at idle), since the memory won&#39;t clock down with the default monitor settings. I have found a workaround, but it requires manual tinkering every time i boot the system. I want to automate this process so that I wouldn&#39;t need to do it every time.</p> <p><strong>My Specs</strong>:</p> <p>Monitor: SAMSUNG G70A 4k@144hz</p> <p>GPU: AMD RX 5700 (connected via displayport 1.4a)</p> <p>KERNEL: 5.18.12-arch1-1</p> <p>Desktop: KDE Plasma 5.25.3 X11</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p> <p>If system is booted with monitor refresh rate that is higher than 60hz and freesync option on (in the monitor menu) it is not possible override the settings no matter what I do. I can change the resolution, or refresh rate to any value, but the GPU memory won&#39;t clock down.</p> <p><strong>Manual Workaround:</strong></p> <ol> <li>In the monitor menu, change refresh rate setting to 60hz and turn off freesync option.</li> <li>Restart the OS</li> <li>When the OS is fully loaded, in the monitor menu tun on freesync option.</li> <li>Then apply these settings with xrandr:</li> </ol> <p>&#x200B;</p> <pre><code>$ xrandr --newmode &quot;3840x2160_140.00_rb2&quot; 1267.18 3840 3848 3880 3920 2160 2295 2303 2309 +hsync -vsync $ xrandr --addmode DisplayPort-1 &quot;3840x2160_140.00_rb2&quot; $ xrandr --output DisplayPort-1 --mode &quot;3840x2160_140.00_rb2&quot; </code></pre> <p>After these steps the GPU memory is clocking down normally. If I try to do any of these steps out of order, the GPU memory clock will again get stuck at max speed.</p> <p>When I want to shut down, or restart the OS, I have to return the refresh rate to 60hz and turn off freesync, otherwise on the next boot, the workaround will not work.</p> <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p> <ul> <li>I can automate the xrandr settings for boot and shutdown, but is there some way to automate turning on the freesync setting, so that I wouldn&#39;t need to manually set it on every boot and shutdown?</li> <li>What is actually happening on boot time that overrides any attempt to change the blanking times? I have a suspicion, that some settings are set after the OS checks the monitor configuration on boot time and those settings are somehow immutable, but I have no idea what those would be and if I may somehow override them with a script?</li> </ul> <p>Any ideas? This issue with high GPU idle consumption has been plaguing me for 4 years (in various forms), there has to be some way to solve this in a sane way...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hxfhjkl"> /u/Hxfhjkl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5bsr1/how_to_override_default_monitor_blanking_times/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5bsr1/how_to_override_default_monitor_blanking_times/">[comments]</a></span>
