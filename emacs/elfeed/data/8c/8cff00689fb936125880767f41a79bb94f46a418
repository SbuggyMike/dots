to change copyright law to permit machine
learning systems to scan copyrighted web sites to construct language
models.
<p>
Copyright should allow people to study copyrighted works to learn
from them, as a matter of basic principle.  That includes adducing
patterns in how language is used.
<p>
If people want a law to prohibit studying works of text or art to make
programs that generate text or art, this should be a separate law so
that it doesn't mess up other uses of studying works, or other ways of
reusing aspects of works.  We must not let Big Tech add copyright
restrictions, since they will design it to give them more power over
us.
