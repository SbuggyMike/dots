(<a href="https://youtu.be/W6ERiQFu1GU">https://youtu.be/W6ERiQFu1GU</a>)</p> <p>I&#39;m planning on composing a symphonic poem that has a solo viola in it, and I&#39;d like to use the same thing on the viola. However I&#39;m unknown to the world of string instruments advanced techniques and limitations. How hard is it to play a dynamic melodies on two octaves at once? What are the limitations and where can I learn about them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ani____"> /u/Ani____ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w83zpe/questions_for_viola_players_out_here_and_maybe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w83zpe/questions_for_viola_players_out_here_and_maybe/">[comments]</a></span>
