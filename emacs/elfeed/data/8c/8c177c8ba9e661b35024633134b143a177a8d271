<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/PSaFMcrivyY">https://youtube.com/shorts/PSaFMcrivyY</a> This is Mozart&#39;s Gigue KV 574, arranged for harpsichord (midi rendition) and tuned into Golden Meantone, the meantone system defined by setting the relation between the whole tone and diatonic semitone intervals to be the Golden Ratio φ=1/2*(5<sup>1/2</sup>+1)≈1.6180… This makes the Golden fifth exactly (8−φ)/11 octaves, or (9600−1200φ)/11 cents, approximately 696.214 cents. This in turn implies that the ratio between the diatonic semitone and the chromatic semitone is the Golden Ratio as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/claudi_meneghin"> /u/claudi_meneghin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13366xo/mozart_gigue_kv_574_for_harpsichord/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13366xo/mozart_gigue_kv_574_for_harpsichord/">[comments]</a></span>
