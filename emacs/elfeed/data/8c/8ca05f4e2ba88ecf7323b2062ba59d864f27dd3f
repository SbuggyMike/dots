<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I&#39;m looking at RK Royal Kludge mechanical keyboards for use on Fedora and Ubuntu. I want to make sure I can get all the features, mainly RGB lighting control and macros. For RGB control, it seems OpenRGB should work for this. </p> <p>For macros - I&#39;m having a bit of trouble determining the solution here. I came across xkbcomp, but can this be done to set macros? Maybe I&#39;m using the wrong term and that&#39;s why I&#39;m not finding anything in my searches? I&#39;m basically looking for being able to trigger scripts or key combos in 1 button push like G buttons on Logitech keyboards (and on the RK product page on Amazon, it refers to this as macros). </p> <p>Also, are there other features, tools, or tips I should be looking at to take advantage of these keyboards? Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gpzj94"> /u/gpzj94 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w8rwgf/xkbcomp_macros/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w8rwgf/xkbcomp_macros/">[comments]</a></span>
