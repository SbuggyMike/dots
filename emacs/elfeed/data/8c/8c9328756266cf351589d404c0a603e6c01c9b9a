<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>GM Sam Shankland hosted a 50 board simul yesterday at the Berkeley Chess School and I was lucky enough to be able to attend. Sam was super cool and I was impressed with how he was basically running up and down the room playing moves instantly for over 4 hours. I knew that I was going to get destroyed going in so, instead of trying to be solid, I decided to have some fun.</p> <p>If anyone&#39;s interested, <a href="https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/pgn/3mQS4DQmjC">here&#39;s the link to the chesscom analysis board</a></p> <p>We opened with the Caro-Kann: Advance, Short Variation but I decided to deviate from the theoretical 7...c4, closing the diagonal, by playing 7...Nc3 instead, hoping he would go for the easy 8.Na4 attack on my queen. He did, and after countering my check, he attacked my queen by pushing 10.b4 and here&#39;s where I went wrong. I knew I wanted to sac a either my knight or bishop on b4 but I chose... poorly. I sacrificed my bishop, thinking that I hadn&#39;t developed my kingside and that getting it out of the way early might help me, and that recapturing with my knight would offer good forking opportunities on c2. Alas, I was wrong but, to my shock, he blundered right back by playing 12.Bd2! Honestly, if I had a couple minutes I might have found Bc2 attacking the queen and forcing it away from protecting the a4 knight but I was caught off guard and still thinking about my earlier ideas of forking on c2 with my knight. Sadly, the tactic didn&#39;t work out and he was able to cement an advantage that he would obviously never lose after that point.</p> <p>All in all, I had a blast. I just started playing OTB this year and, personally, I&#39;m proud that I managed to last over 40 moves (I&#39;m only 1230 FIDE) and could&#39;ve dragged it out longer until mate but decided to call it a day. Sam was super friendly and impressive and I came away with a couple ideas to ponder about the short variation for my next OTB games. He&#39;s leaving for India today to represent the US in the chess olympiad and I wish him the best of luck!</p> <p>Here&#39;s the PGN:</p> <ol> <li>e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Nf3 e6 5. Be2 c5 6.
