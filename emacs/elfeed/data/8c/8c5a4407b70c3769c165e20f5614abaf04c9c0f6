*Manhattan DA who indicted Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/11/alvin-bragg-sues-republican-jim-jordan-trump-case-interference">sues Republican Jim Jordan over
    interference in case</a>.*
<p>
The interference consists of demanding to subpoena one of the DA's
investigators, trying to find something to accuse him of.

I don't understand the legal issues enough to know whether there was
any actual wrongdoing, but in general no one is more likely to lie than
a Republican official.
