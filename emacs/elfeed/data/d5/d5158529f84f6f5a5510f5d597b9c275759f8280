<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Compared to the compositional zeitgeist of academia, my music is much more &quot;traditionally&quot; oriented, but I am definitely developing my own take on &quot;modernity&quot; with this piece. I&#39;d say the work is a blend of Orff&#39;s <em>Carmina Burana</em>, the music of 20th-century Russians (Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Stravinsky), Star Wars, and of course, my own personal style :) Please enjoy! </p> <p>Sound library is NotePerformer. </p> <p>Link to score and .mp3: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/140G1NX_afqddc45qMbFc0SRNzMt567c3">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/140G1NX_afqddc45qMbFc0SRNzMt567c3</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jgmakesnoises"> /u/jgmakesnoises </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1336pt4/just_finished_my_composition_masters_thesis/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1336pt4/just_finished_my_composition_masters_thesis/">[comments]</a></span>
