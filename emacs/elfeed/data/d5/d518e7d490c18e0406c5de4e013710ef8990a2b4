<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let me start by saying, yes, I did indeed try to use the manual installation of the key indicated by the pinned comment on the AUR page <code>gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --search-keys 662E3CDD6FE329002D0CA5BB40339DD82B12EF16</code></p> <p>It continues to return the error <code>gpg: error searching keyserver: Server indicated a failure gpg: keyserver search failed: Server indicated a failure</code></p> <p>I even tried replacing <code>hkp</code> with <code>hkps</code> and have not been successful. Anyone have any ideas what is happening? Thanks for any help!</p> <p>Edit (FIXED): Apparently with some firewall stuff you need to specify the port. My new command is now <code>gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --search-keys 662E3CDD6FE329002D0CA5BB40339DD82B12EF16</code></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MushroomGecko"> /u/MushroomGecko </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/133ckdj/librewolfbin_error/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/133ckdj/librewolfbin_error/">[comments]</a></span>
