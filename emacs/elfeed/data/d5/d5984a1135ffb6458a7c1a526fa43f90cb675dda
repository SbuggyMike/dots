<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: I GOT IT TO WORK!! Alright so if anyone else is having this problem, You need to set the kernel params to ibt=off, because of a recent bug. (which I did), however I didnâ€™t have linux-headers installed at the same time, because if you have linux-headers installed without ibt=off, your system doesn&#39;t boot. This resulted in me testing ibt=off without linux headers installed, which made it do nothing! </p> <p>Well it&#39;s common sense (I guess) that nvidia would need linux-headers to work, it is not a depend and it says this no where in the wiki. Anyone know why? If those things where true it would&#39;ve helped me fix the problem a lot faster.</p> <p>Hi, I have a G15 5511 laptop with an RTX 3050 Mobile.</p> <p>I&#39;ve gone through forms, wiki&#39;s, videos, and I can&#39;t figure out how to get my dedicated graphics to work and it&#39;s hurting my brain. </p> <p>Also, my second monitor doesn&#39;t work and doesn&#39;t even show up in xrandr. </p> <p>I&#39;m using bspwm so this also adds to the learning experience as I&#39;ve never used a window manager before. </p> <p>Any help would be appreciated, (also suggestions for window manager stuff is helpful, like what program should I use to style my qt apps.) (or if I should switch window managers, but I don&#39;t want to use sway as ive heard wayland is even worse for nvidia stuff)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Hopefully somewhat helpful logs: </p> <p>$ inxi -G </p> <p><a href="https://pastebin.com/jU1ReT8k">https://pastebin.com/jU1ReT8k</a></p> <p>$ prime-run glxgears</p> <p><a href="https://pastebin.com/W7UjKZwA">https://pastebin.com/W7UjKZwA</a></p> <p>$ xrandr --listproviders</p> <p><a href="https://pastebin.com/yQwTPnPs">https://pastebin.com/yQwTPnPs</a></p> <p>$ xrandr --listmonitors</p> <p><a href="https://pastebin.com/BMRyszMh">https://pastebin.com/BMRyszMh</a></p> <p>DRI_PRIME=1 does nothing</p> <p>I suspect that the issue starts with xrandr not seeing the other gpu, which also might be the reason my other monitor doesn&#39;t work. </p> <p>So yeah if anyone else has hybrid NVIDIA graphics please share your wisdom with me :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The-8-Bit-Wolf"> /u/The-8-Bit-Wolf </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wi4gwq/need_help_with_nvidia_hybrid_graphics/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wi4gwq/need_help_with_nvidia_hybrid_graphics/">[comments]</a></span>
