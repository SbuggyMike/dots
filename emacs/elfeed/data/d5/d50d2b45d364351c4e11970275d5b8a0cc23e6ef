<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always been an Ubuntu guy (now Lubuntu) but I&#39;d like to step my game up and move to Arch so I can learn a bit more.

Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/frenetickticktick"> /u/frenetickticktick </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7bzmq/expected_challenges_switching_to_arch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7bzmq/expected_challenges_switching_to_arch/">[comments]</a></span>
