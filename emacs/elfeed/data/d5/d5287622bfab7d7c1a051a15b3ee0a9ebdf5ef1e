UK "anti-terrorist"
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/18/french-publisher-arrested-london-counter-terrorism-police-ernest-moret">thugs arrested a French publisher</a>
visiting
the London Book Fair.  They accused him of having some sort of
involvement in the mass protests against President Macron.
<p>
This inculpates both the UK government and the French government in
repression against protesters.  In addition, it demonstrates <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2017-sep-dec.html#28_October_2017_(Anti-terror_laws)">the UK's
disrespect for the rights</a>
of the accused.
<p>
It is not the first time that the UK has used this repressive law against
journalism.
<p>
In 2014, David Miranda. whose spouse is Glen Greenwald, flew through
London with
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2013-may-aug.html#20_August_2013_(David_Miranda)">a disk containing copy of Greenwald's data from reporting</a>,
including on Snowden.  UK <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> arrested Miranda and threatened to
imprison him for years if he did not immediately hand over the keys to
that data.
<p>
Flying through the UK is <a href="/archives/2021-may-aug.html#25_May_2021_(Belarus_forced_down_an_airliner)">comparable to flying over Belarus</a>.  The
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2017-sep-dec.html#28_October_2017_(Anti-terror_laws)">UK government should be ashamed of itself</a>.
