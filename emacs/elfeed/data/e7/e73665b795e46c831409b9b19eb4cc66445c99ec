<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to record my screen using OBS and VA-API, but the recorded video has a horrible video quality.</p> <p>I&#39;m using an AMD RX 5700 GPU and followed all the necessary steps to get <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration">hardware video acceleration</a> working in general.</p> <p>Then I installed the <code>obs-gstreamer</code> plugin, <code>gstreamer-vaaapi</code> and <code>ffmpeg-obs</code> which comes with <code>--enable-vaaapi</code>.</p> <p>In OBS I choose the <em>GStreamer Encoder</em> (VA-API) and tried to simply record my whole desktop. But the video quality is really horrible as you can see here and sometimes even flickers weirdly: <a href="https://imgur.com/wCPUpSu">https://imgur.com/wCPUpSu</a></p> <p>What am I missing? Is there a bug or any other error with my GPU drivers? Or have I set something up the wrong way?</p> <p>Using the usual libx264 encoder works fine, btw.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Arjab"> /u/Arjab </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wc5qx5/screen_recording_using_obs_and_vaapi_return/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wc5qx5/screen_recording_using_obs_and_vaapi_return/">[comments]</a></span>
