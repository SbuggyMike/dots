<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello dear redditors,</p> <p>I have a problem using tramp with my ssh config file and <code>ProxyJump</code> . I just can&#39;t figure out why it does not work. The situation is the folowoing:</p> <p>Machine_A ---&gt; JumpMachine ---&gt; Machine_B</p> <p>My ssh config for that looks as follows:</p> <pre><code>Host Machine_B Hostname &lt;some_ip&gt; User &lt;my_username&gt; Port &lt;some_port&gt; ProxyJump JumpMachine ServerAliveInterval 60 Host JumpMachine Hostname &lt;some_ip&gt; User &lt;Some_user&gt; Port &lt;some_port&gt; ProxyCommand &lt;a_simple_bashscript&gt; IdentityFile &lt;my_identiyfile&gt; Host Machine_B_admin Hostname &lt;some_ip&gt; User &lt;my_admin_username&gt; Port &lt;some_port&gt; ProxyJump JumpMachine ServerAliveInterval 60 </code></pre> <p>Machine B has no PW auth, only the jumpmachine. Both can be obviously accesed using ssh. The setup works with my shell (fish) as well as other shells and with vscode.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>What is really strange, is that that tramp always asks me for <code>ssh:Machine_B passsword:</code> while only the <code>JumpMachine</code> has a password. The PW auth is turned off for ssh on <code>Machine_B</code>. I tried using the password for <code>JumpMachine</code> and <code>Machine_B</code> and neither works. TBH I am not really sure what to do by now.</p> <p>I just wanted to mention that there is also another entry for my admin account. Don&#39;t know if that matters in any way.</p> <p>Any tips?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dry-leaf"> /u/dry-leaf </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3i8rr/ssh_config_proxyjump_not_applied/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3i8rr/ssh_config_proxyjump_not_applied/">[comments]</a></span>
