again, killing some leaders of
Islamic Jihad.
<p>
The air raids
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/gaza-under-attack">bombed civilians too</a>.

In general, killing leaders of a guerrilla movement has little effect
on it.  There are always new leaders ready to step in.  If they are
religious fanatics. the possibility of a martyr's death may not
discourage them.
<p>
The only way to get end the fighting is to change the factors that encourage
people to join up.
