<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a wireless barcode scanner (Wasp WWS250i) that doesn&#39;t want to pair with my laptop. I&#39;ll go to pair it, and BlueZ tells me it&#39;s paired, but the scanner is still acting like it&#39;s searching to pair (blinking blue light), and when I try to connect to it, it keeps connecting and disconnecting.</p> <p>I tried it on my Windows machine, and it works just fine. From what I understand, all it does is emulate a keyboard, so I don&#39;t think I need any special drivers.</p> <p>Using an X1 Carbon 3rd gen. I also tried a different bluetooth manager and bluetoothctl with similar results.</p> <p>Any ideas on how I should go about troubleshooting this? Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Eggsmuffins"> /u/Eggsmuffins </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131b9ah/bluetooth_barcode_scanner_not_pairing_with_laptop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131b9ah/bluetooth_barcode_scanner_not_pairing_with_laptop/">[comments]</a></span>
