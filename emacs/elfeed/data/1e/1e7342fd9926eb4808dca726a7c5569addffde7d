I too wrote some code and I&#39;d like to share it with you. The project is called Zari and it has now reached a state in which I feel like it&#39;s worthy of a 0.1.0 release. </p> <p>Of course, since this is my first Rust project and with it being just the first release I bet there are some coding guidelines or standards I&#39;m breaking, so please let me know if you see any improvements!</p> <h1>What is it?</h1> <p>Zari is a task execution program with a focus on simplicity and giving control to the user.</p> <p>In short, it allows you to configure multiple one-liners which will be executed sequentially. By letting Zari handle these commands, you can configure once and forget about it. An example would be to update all the various package managers on your system!</p> <h1>Where to find it</h1> <p>As of yet, it doesn&#39;t have any fancy custom-website. However I tried to document it as well as I could, so all the information you might need can be found on: <a href="https://codeberg.org/tosti007/zari">the Codeberg Project Page</a>. Or jump right to <a href="https://codeberg.org/tosti007/zari/releases/latest">the release page</a>.</p> <h1>Features</h1> <p>Zari has various features, but most notably:</p> <ul> <li>Configurable tasks</li> <li>Retry upon failure</li> <li>One command, multiple arguments</li> <li>Include separate task files</li> </ul> <h1>Why I wrote Zari</h1> <p>I basically just wrote this because I felt like rocking my own (more specifically I wanted something different compared to Topgrade) and needed an excuse to use Rust as a programming language.</p> <h1>Zari compared to Topgrade</h1> <p>Topgrade was what inspired me to make Zari, I wanted a single command to update my entire system with and run some periodic tasks. However, I found Topgrade to do too much on an opt-out basis. I prefer my system to be opt-in, where I have to explicitly tell it to run selected commands. Most notably, I had this issue with pip, where I manage all packages either through virtual environments, or install them globally though the system package manager. However, when I ran Topgrade it updated my pip to a newer version without asking me to beforehand. Nonetheless, it is possible to have Topgrade execute custom commands, but I wanted a different feature set than what they currently offered.</p> <h1>Why do I post 2 weeks after the actual release on codeberg?</h1> <p>I was on holiday for 2 weeks and basically did the release a few hours before leaving, but I am back now! Germany and Poland are beautiful countries and definetly worth a visit.</p> <p>PS: I posted this on <a href="/r/linux">r/linux</a>, and <a href="/r/rust">r/rust</a>, <a href="/r/archlinux">r/archlinux</a>, and <a href="/r/commandline">r/commandline</a>. Got another suggestion? Let me know!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tosti007"> /u/tosti007 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w6yjo1/announcing_zari_010_a_command_to_run_all_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w6yjo1/announcing_zari_010_a_command_to_run_all_your/">[comments]</a></span>
