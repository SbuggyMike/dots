<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried so many different things without success that I resort to asking here. I&#39;m trying to get python3.10 on my raspberry pi which runs an ARM1176 processor with the <code>armv6l</code> architecture.</p> <p>My first and most obvious attempt was to run a QEMU machine with the same OS and architecture, that way I could just compile there. I couldn&#39;t get a VM with the same architecture, the closest I got to it was running something similar to</p> <pre><code>qemu-system-arm -machine raspi1ap -cpu arm1176 -kernel &quot;./vmlinuz&quot; -initrd &quot;./initrd.gz&quot; -cdrom file=debian-11.4.0-armhf-netinst.iso </code></pre> <p>This would just give me a black screen and max a processor, even though I got the kernel and initrd from the right place for the iso (I got it working this way for another architecture). Prior to this I did get one ARM machine to boot and compile okay, but I didn&#39;t have the right machine and cpu parameters so the executables wouldn&#39;t run on the pi.</p> <p>Then, I went on to the second most obvious option which is to use the AUR packages for ARM cross-compilation. I managed to install them, but the executables wouldn&#39;t run because I had the wrong version of <code>libc</code> with them. I tried matching the <code>gcc</code> version from the pi, which is 10.2.1, the git from the AUR gave me 10.2.0 but that version required <code>libc&gt;=2.33</code> when the pi has <code>libc</code> version <code>2.31</code>.</p> <p>One final attempt was to run a QEMU machine of the same Debian version but <code>x86_64</code>, and within it to cross-compile. That also failed because they don&#39;t include the machine <code>armv6</code> anymore in their cross-compilers, so you would need to get the cross-compiler from some other shady source.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/7dare"> /u/7dare </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb4lli/cross_compiling_for_a_specific_architecture_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb4lli/cross_compiling_for_a_specific_architecture_and/">[comments]</a></span>
