The US <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/07/28/nigeria-civilian-displaced-bombing-us/">assisted in a Nigerian air raid</a> on a displaced persons' camp,
which killed aid workers and civilians; then it secretly investigated
what had happened.

The raid was intended to target terrorists, but something went very
wrong in the planning.
