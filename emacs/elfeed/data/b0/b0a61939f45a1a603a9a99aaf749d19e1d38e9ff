<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some months ago I started getting an &quot;ambiguous output redirect&quot; error everytime a new tcsh shell is started. I&#39;ve removed my ~/.cshrc and the problem persists and I also see this under the root-account where I don&#39;t normally use tcsh, so it doesn&#39;t appear to be related to anything in my home-directory.</p> <p>Does anyone have tips or tricks for helping to track down the source of the error? </p> <p>The only redirect I found in system files is at /etc/profile.d/debuginfod.csh and it appears to be well-formed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blahhumbug22"> /u/blahhumbug22 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb9m50/tcsh_and_ambiguous_output_redirect_on_each_new/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb9m50/tcsh_and_ambiguous_output_redirect_on_each_new/">[comments]</a></span>
