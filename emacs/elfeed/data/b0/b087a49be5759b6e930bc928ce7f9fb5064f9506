<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I am running Arch on a Thinkpad P50 with DWM as my window manager. I&#39;m experiencing a problem with waking the computer from lid-closed sleep, where the computer wakes but the screen is black, except for a small horizontal line at the topmost left corner of the screen. The keyboard won&#39;t respond in this state, so I can&#39;t get another terminal open to diagnose or kill the display manager. </p> <p>Arch is otherwise running perfectly on the P50, but this issue is really annoying and I would love to resolve it. The problem is that I don&#39;t know where to start, and would really appreciate some guidance / tips from the community. I perused the forums and reddit, and couldn&#39;t find a post with the same issue - but I am sure that this is not unique to me. I&#39;m running 5.18.13-arch1-1. No display manager is used; just a call to exec dwm in .xinitrc. </p> <p>I can provide whatever logging info would be helpful. I have the same build running on a Thinkpad X220, and that installation is bullet proof - so I wonder if it has to do with the hybrid graphics setup on the P50? I have the following graphics drivers installed: mesa, lib32-mesa, nvidia.</p> <p>Thanks again.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Away_Inflation_411"> /u/Away_Inflation_411 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6dslx/thinkpad_p50_dwm_problem_on_wake_from_lid_closed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6dslx/thinkpad_p50_dwm_problem_on_wake_from_lid_closed/">[comments]</a></span>
