<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Anyone else feel like chess.com&#39;s leagues are a rather crap and pointless endevour? I mean, seriously, what&#39;s the point to them?</p> <p>There&#39;s no denying that the league system lacks any real substance. It&#39;s as if they forgot to add any incentives to reach the top or consequences for being at the bottom. It&#39;s like an escalator that only goes up, sure you can struggle and stay on the same few steps, but sorry little Timmy, you&#39;re going to the top, where you and everyone else will be stuck forever. You just move up slowly without any real challenge or sense of accomplishment.</p> <p>Let&#39;s face it, the league system seems to measure one thing and one thing only: who plays way too much chess</p> <p>Instead of this monotonous cycle of mediocrity, how about introducing a league system that actually has some form of a point? Imagine a system with relegation and promotion, where players truly have something at stake. The higher the league youre in, you could get special styling on your name or a cool badge, maybe even exclusive events for the Legend league that someone smarter than me could figure out.</p> <p>Idk, I&#39;m just brainstorming. It would at least give the league system more of a point, and it would still be fulfilling the same function from chess.com&#39;s perspective, we degenerates will still play too much chess and might even encourage more degeneracy, win-win!</p> <p>So, anyone else thinking along the same lines? Are you as bemused with the lackluster league system as I am? Let&#39;s seize the means of en passant and get shit changed</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KobokTukath"> /u/KobokTukath </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jfc4w/chesscoms_league_system_a_neverending_escalator/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jfc4w/chesscoms_league_system_a_neverending_escalator/">[comments]</a></span>
