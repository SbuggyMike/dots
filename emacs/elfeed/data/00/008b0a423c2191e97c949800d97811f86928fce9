<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It is unusual for text editors to come with the same kind of productivity tools as Emacs does. Especially on UNIX-like systems, people typically expect their software to be focused and useful for a dedicated purpose, yet GNU Emacs decides to do the opposite.</p> <p>What is the philosophy behind this design practice? Furthermore, how would a user benefit from these features if they decide to use them instead of using popular, dedicated third-party applications?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FortunateDaughter_"> /u/FortunateDaughter_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138kr5m/whats_that_email_client_doing_here/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138kr5m/whats_that_email_client_doing_here/">[comments]</a></span>
