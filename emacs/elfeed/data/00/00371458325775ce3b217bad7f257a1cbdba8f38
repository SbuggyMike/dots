<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im thinking we (the community) should create an AUR package of the ungoogled-chromium compiled binary.</p> <p>For those who are unfamiliar with the project:<br/> Ungoogled chromium is a set of patches for the Chromium project, which aims to remove everything related to google (and by the way also maximize performance and privacy).<br/> Usually it takes some hours at 100% CPU usage to compile the project and &quot;make&quot; the binary.</p> <p>Now, Gentoo&#39;s community already has an ebuild (equivalent of PKGBUILD) for `ungoogled-chromium-bin`<br/> Here is the binary builds repository :<br/> <a href="https://github.com/PF4Public/ungoogled-chromium-bin/releases/tag/103.0.5060.134">https://github.com/PF4Public/ungoogled-chromium-bin/releases/</a></p> <p>Im sure we can create a PKGBUILD (AUR package) out of those, Maybe even make them updated automatically with each new version release pushed to the remote repository? </p> <p>Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CodesWhite"> /u/CodesWhite </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcfds1/binary_for_ungoogled_chromium/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcfds1/binary_for_ungoogled_chromium/">[comments]</a></span>
