<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to share a little project I created - as an alternative to KDEConnect - which displays your Android phone notifications on your Linux desktop. It is called Android 2 Linux Notifications.</p> <p>It basically consists of a simple Android app (available on Google Play and F-Droid) and a server which runs on your computer written in Python. They communicate over LAN (including encryption and authentication of course). It is very easy to set-up and doesn&#39;t contain unnecessary features in my opinion.</p> <p>Here are some links in case you are interested:</p> <ul> <li>GitHub repositories (contributions are welcome!): <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/patri9ck/a2ln-server">Server</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/patri9ck/a2ln-app">App</a></li> </ul></li> <li>App Download <ul> <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.patri9ck.a2ln">Google Play</a></li> <li><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.patri9ck.a2ln/">F-Droid</a> (don&#39;t wonder, the screenshots are broken there)</li> </ul></li> <li><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/a2ln">Server is available on the AUR</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.patri9ck.dev/a2ln/">Basically everything you need to know including how to set it up and install everything</a></li> </ul> <p>I really hope you like it! In case you have a question, just write a comment here or create an issue on GitHub.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/patri9ck"> /u/patri9ck </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2aojh/view_your_android_phone_notifications_on_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2aojh/view_your_android_phone_notifications_on_your/">[comments]</a></span>
