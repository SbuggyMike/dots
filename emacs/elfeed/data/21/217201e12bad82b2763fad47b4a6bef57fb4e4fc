<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Dear Folks,</p> <p>After some of the last updates, i am not able to compile rather well maintained programs. The problem arises because <code>uint8_t</code> is not part of the standard c++ library (anymore?) so some research points out that in this case <code>#include &lt;cstdint&gt;</code> has to be included. This can be done for my own projects, however manually chaning all files of huge projects which i haven&#39;t programmed myself seems ridiculous but trying to build pretty usual programs from the AUR yields in a waterfall of error messages. Did i somehow forget to configure something? Or do just all programs simply have to obey new versions of standard library syntax?</p> <p>Also similar to this problem i can&#39;t run certain python programs in a conda env because conda expects its own <code>libstdc++.so.6</code> to be compatible with <code>GLIBCXX_3.4.30</code>, however this is not the case because conda uses 6.0.29 and arch uses 6.0.31, which apparently uses glibcxx 3.4.30. Well this problem can be worked around by renaming condas libstdc++ file, such that it searches somewhere else on the system. But this is really annoying tbh. Is there a recommended solution for this?</p> <p>glibc 2.37-3</p> <p>lib32-glibc 2.37-3</p> <p>gcc 13.1.1-1</p> <p>gcc-libs 13.1.1-1</p> <p>gcc12 12.3.0-1</p> <p>gcc12-libs 12.3.0-1</p> <p>lib32-gcc-libs 13.1.1-1</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maxawake"> /u/maxawake </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13j4zgs/uint8_t_does_not_name_a_type_and_glibcxx_3430_not/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13j4zgs/uint8_t_does_not_name_a_type_and_glibcxx_3430_not/">[comments]</a></span>
