<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a big fan of the sadly underrated French composer Albert Roussel ( 1869-1937 ) , who has been undeservedly overshadowed by his contemporaries Debussy and Ravel for so long . His four symphonies , ballets &quot;The Spider&#39;s Feast &quot;, &quot;Bacchus &amp; Ariane &quot; , opera &quot;Padmavati &quot; and other works. deserve to be better known . Roussel&#39;s music is one of a kind ; it&#39;s not. &quot;impressionist &quot; nor does it follow any &quot;isms&quot;. although it has been described as &quot;neoclassic &quot; by some critics . </p> <p>Roussel&#39;s music is rugged and earthy and his harmonies more spiky and dissonant than those of Debussy and Ravel ; his orchestration s a colorful as. theirs , but sounds like no one else&#39;s .</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Superhorn345"> /u/Superhorn345 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13ior1s/any_fans_of_albert_roussel_here/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13ior1s/any_fans_of_albert_roussel_here/">[comments]</a></span>
