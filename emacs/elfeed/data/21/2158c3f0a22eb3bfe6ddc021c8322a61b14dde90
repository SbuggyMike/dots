<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need to encrypt my system and is my dev environment, what’s mind, if I can not solve it on a weekend I need the pc running by the next Monday morning so, do you think using for example CloneZilla is a good tool to recovery my system in case of failure? Would you recommend something else? Thanks in advance. I could also manually copy the file system and the efi partition.. but this could lead to some issues and I’m afraid of timing.
