<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks,</p> <p>I&#39;ve recently been trying to get off dropbox and iCloud in favour of risilio sync, synching and seafile.</p> <p>I&#39;m having a lot of trouble with conflicts though, it seems that every change causes a conflict that I have to resolve manually.</p> <p>I hate to say it, but dropbox was the most robust solution. I wanted to stop paying a monthly fee and own my data, but the friction it has introduced is unexpected. </p> <p>What do you use and what&#39;s your workflow like?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/trae"> /u/trae </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wg4cen/what_do_you_use_to_sync_org_content_across_devices/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wg4cen/what_do_you_use_to_sync_org_content_across_devices/">[comments]</a></span>
