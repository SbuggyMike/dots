<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My elfeed is focused on finding papers and when I check out each entry, there is a PMID and DOI number at the end. </p> <p><code>PMID:39334129 | DOI:10.1207/s12102-021-03242-8</code></p> <p>I wanted to call a function that records the entry into my .bib file and at the same time downloads the PDF of that paper if available using my python function. I cannot seem to do these two actions in a single function so I have to use two functions (one for PMID to get the pdf and other for DOI to get entered into .bib file) which work fine separately:</p> <pre><code>(defun extract-PMID-DOI (regexp) (interactive (list (read-regexp &quot;Regexp: &quot;))) (isearch-mode t t) (let ((isearch-regexp nil)) (isearch-yank-string regexp))) (defun fetch-pubmed-pdf () (interactive) (extract-PMID-DOI &quot;PMID:&quot;) ;; puts cursor on PMID number (insert (shell-command-to-string (concat &quot;python3 /home/user/fetch_pdfs.py -out /home/user/papers/pdfs/ -pmids &quot; (current-word)))) ) (defun fetch-pubmed-doi () (interactive) (extract-PMID-DOI &quot;DOI:10.&quot;) ;; puts cursor on DOI number (doi-utils-add-bibtex-entry-from-doi (concat &quot;10.&quot; (current-word)) &quot;~/papers/ref.bib&quot;) ) </code></pre> <p>I wanted to know if there is a way for me to combine the two functions <code>fetch-pubmed-pdf</code> and <code>fetch-pubmed-doi</code> into a single function and also if there is a way to link the pdf that was downloaded in my <code>/home/user/papers/pdfs/</code> to the .bib entry obtained from the doi?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/waterstrider123"> /u/waterstrider123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whzms6/extraction_of_reference_and_pdf_from_elfeedentry/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whzms6/extraction_of_reference_and_pdf_from_elfeedentry/">[comments]</a></span>
