<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good morning, happy Tuesday, and welcome to another week of our sub&#39;s revamped listening club. Each week, we&#39;ll listen to a piece you guys recommend, discuss it, learn about it, and hopefully introduce you to music you wouldn&#39;t hear otherwise :)</p> <p>Last week, we listened to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w9fdri/potw_31_reger_six_intermezzi_op45/">Reger&#39;s Six Intermezzi, op.45</a>. You can go back to listen, read up, and discuss the works if you want to</p> <p>Our latest Piece of the Week is <strong>Kurt Atterberg&#39;s Symphony no.3 in D Major, &quot;Pictures of the West Coast&quot; (1916)</strong></p> <p>some listening notes from <a href="http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2001/jan01/atterberg.htm">Lewis Foreman</a></p> <blockquote> <p>The Third Symphony was written during the first two years of the Great War, and is a remarkably effective and attractive symphony, with a nature programme. Some commentators have been moved to judge it the best of Atterberg&#39;s symphonies, and I would not dissent from that. The composer called it Västkustbilder (&#39;West Coast Pictures&#39;) and I have also seen it referred to by the English title &#39;Ocean Pictures&#39; and the German &#39;Meeressymphonie&#39;, all of which seem adequate as descriptions of the symphony&#39;s programmatic material. The arrangement of the three movements - two slow movements divided by a quick one - is remarkably effective. The movements are &#39;Soldis&#39; (translated in the booklet as &#39;Sun smoke&#39; - &#39;Sun haze&#39; gives a better idea), &#39;Storm&#39; and &#39;Sommernatt&#39;. The exciting storm music in the vivid middle movement is strongly reminiscent of the climax of Arnold Bax&#39;s orchestral tone-poem November Woods, which, when I asked Atterberg about it in the early 1970s, he assured me he had never heard.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ways to Listen</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iUIiVVGUHs">YouTube - Sixten Ehrling with the Malmo Symphony Orchestra</a>, includes score</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0xeovbKyNJTZWKG1YQn1rJ?si=IGXv2PlwQVqz_il5eZt4Lg">Spotify - Ari Rasilainen and the Hannover Radio Philharmonic Orchestra</a></p></li> <li><p>[Spotify - Neeme Järvi and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra](<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/23nOLiB5Hl3ZoyFITAOOQq?si=YLfy4xKORLCufxjC96D_JA_">https://open.spotify.com/album/23nOLiB5Hl3ZoyFITAOOQq?si=YLfy4xKORLCufxjC96D_JA_</a></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Discussion Prompts</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>What are your favorite parts or moments in this work?
