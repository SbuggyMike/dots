*Biden says Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/26/biden-trump-january-6-capitol-riot-courage">"lacked the courage to act"</a> during January 6 attack.*
<p>
What a bizarre understatement!  The wrecker had already acted, by
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-may-aug.html#24_July_2022_(Powerful_evidence)">preparing and launching</a> the attack on the Capitol,
and he continued to act by keeping it going and protecting it.
