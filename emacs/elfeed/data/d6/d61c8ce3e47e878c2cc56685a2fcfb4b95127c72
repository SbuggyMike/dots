<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a long-time arch user, and this is the first time I&#39;ve experienced anything like it. My PC is capping pacman download speeds at about a tenth of the limit. However, my laptop (also Arch) is able to download at full speed via pacman.</p> <p>Recently, I&#39;ve also been experiencing this:</p> <p><code>error: failed retrieving file &#39;qt5-translations-5.15.5+kde+r2-1-any.pkg.tar.zst.sig&#39; from archlinux.thaller.ws : Operation too slow. Less than 1 bytes/sec transferred the last 10 seconds</code></p> <p>I attempted to run Reflector to fix the mirrors, which worked on my laptop but not on the desktop. To be clear, my PC runs everything else at full speed, so this is only a pacman issue. Any help would be appreciated :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Seraphiel9"> /u/Seraphiel9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzr3rl/pacman_is_throttling_on_one_of_my_devices/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzr3rl/pacman_is_throttling_on_one_of_my_devices/">[comments]</a></span>
