<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone I hope you all are doing well!</p> <p>So a few days ago, I gave an update to this Bach concerto project that I was working on and long story short, it involved creating Concerti Grossi out of some of his Cantata Movements. Basically I arranged these typically choral pieces into entirely instrumental ones.</p> <p>After several weeks of mixing and arranging in musescore and tracking down cantatas by key and instrument, I have successfully built my series of &#39;6 Reconstructed Concerti Grossi for Several Instruments&#39; in Musescore!</p> <p>Below is a link to a playlist containing them in full! Please give it a listen, as well as any feedback or suggestions for future projects (all are welcome!) I really enjoy making these arrangements of baroque music! Just something about this era of music just sings to me. I also arrange video game (mostly pokemon) and movie music, but Baroque music will always be one of my favorites!</p> <p>Thank you and please enjoy!</p> <p><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/HhjnjT3o8Ac?feature=share">https://youtube.com/shorts/HhjnjT3o8Ac?feature=share</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OneWhoGetsBread"> /u/OneWhoGetsBread </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wj0wzp/i_recently_finished_reconstructing_a_series_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wj0wzp/i_recently_finished_reconstructing_a_series_of/">[comments]</a></span>
