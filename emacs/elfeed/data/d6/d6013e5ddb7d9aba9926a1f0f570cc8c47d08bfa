<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>While I was reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Leh%C3%A1r#Anecdotes">Franz Lehar</a> after a local production of <em>The Merry Widow</em>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Gustav Mahler and his young wife Alma went to see Leh√°r&#39;s The Merry Widow in Vienna and loved it so much that they danced to its tunes as soon as they were home. From memory they played the waltz on the piano, but could not remember the exact run of one passage. The next day they went to Vienna&#39;s main music shop Doblinger [de], but hesitated to admit that they were looking for the score of what would be considered a &quot;popular&quot; operetta. While Mahler distracted the staff by questioning them about the sales of his own compositions, Alma browsed through the music score of The Merry Widow. As soon as they were out on the street, Alma sang the complete waltz to Mahler.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brings a smile to my lips! I never hear of Gustav and Alma having fun, dancing and humming pop tunes!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FantasiainFminor"> /u/FantasiainFminor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wg7893/a_wonderful_story_ive_come_across_about_mahler/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wg7893/a_wonderful_story_ive_come_across_about_mahler/">[comments]</a></span>
