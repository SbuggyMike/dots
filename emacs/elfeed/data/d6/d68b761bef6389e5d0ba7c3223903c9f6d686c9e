<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only recently stated to keep a backup on a separate drive, but I&#39;m wondering if it is possible to clone a folder, without first deleting it on backup drive and copying everything? Just moving doesn&#39;t work for me, because it doesn&#39;t remove the files that I deleted on my local machine.</p> <p>In short: • Keep the overlapping files (same name, same directory) • Delete the files/folders that are no longer on computer side (that&#39;s the main thing I&#39;m looking for) • Add new files/folders</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/eagleps"> /u/eagleps </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wi87l7/backing_up_a_folder_without_copying_entirely/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wi87l7/backing_up_a_folder_without_copying_entirely/">[comments]</a></span>
