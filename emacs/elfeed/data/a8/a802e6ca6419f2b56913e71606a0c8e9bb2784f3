<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Personally, I prefer ease of use over complexity, sure I don&#39;t get to know the ins and outs of my system, but that&#39;s not why I use my computer, I use it for simple tasks, such as word processing, email, YouTube watching, streaming live TV and movies, so for me, Ubuntu is my preferred Linux distro because I&#39;m not constantly configuring my system to get things done, I have a job and a life and I&#39;d like to live it without fussing over my system when I get home from a long day of work.</p> <p>Coming from a person who has used Windows all his childhood and teenage years, I installed Ubuntu in 2012 and never turned back, I&#39;m very thankful for Ubuntu and Canonical for opening me up to Linux with their easy to use Linux distro, as Linus Torvalds said in 2006, he likes Ubuntu because it made Debian easier to install, configure and use, Linus hates hard to install and to configure LInux distros because he doesn&#39;t want to constantly fight with his system, he wants to get on with his life and that&#39;s kernel development.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ardouronerous"> /u/ardouronerous </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w2ki4a/ubuntu_is_hated_because_its_too_easy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w2ki4a/ubuntu_is_hated_because_its_too_easy/">[comments]</a></span>
