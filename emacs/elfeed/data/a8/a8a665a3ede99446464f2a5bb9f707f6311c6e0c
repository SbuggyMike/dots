<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So here&#39;s my story on why I installed Ubuntu. Back in 2012, my HDD failed on me and my Windows XP install CD wasn&#39;t working anymore. I looked into installing Windows 7, but I couldn&#39;t afford it. After researching my options, I found Ubuntu, I learned how to create a liveUSB and how to install Ubuntu by watching YouTube videos and I managed to install Ubuntu on my laptop and I was pleasantly surprised, because you know the saying, &quot;You get what you paid for,&quot; that usually means if it&#39;s free it&#39;s crap, but that wasn&#39;t the case with Ubuntu though, Ubuntu can do everything Windows 7 can do and my Windows games, like Starcraft, managed to run on Wine, so I was pleasantly surprised. </p> <p>So yeah, I got into Ubuntu, not because I believed in open-source and the free software movement, no, I got into Linux because I&#39;m a cheapskate that couldn&#39;t afford Windows 7, does that make me a bad Linux user?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ardouronerous"> /u/ardouronerous </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w4ehf0/i_got_into_linux_because_i_couldnt_afford_windows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w4ehf0/i_got_into_linux_because_i_couldnt_afford_windows/">[comments]</a></span>
