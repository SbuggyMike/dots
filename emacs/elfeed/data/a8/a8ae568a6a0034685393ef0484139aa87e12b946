<p>Was puttering around with streamdeck-ui on and off... and then finally got around to trying it under 22.04/jammy... and the packaged version Just Works (adding a udev-rules file helps though, which is in the docs but should be in the packaging.)  Now I have to figure out what *other* buttons it makes sense to set up, but the important one is done.</p>
