<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was my setup which was working fine</p> <pre><code>UEFI (Gigabyte x570 Aorus Pro Wifi) PCIe 1: Nvidia card (vfio-pci) - connected to HDMI PCIe 2: AMD card (amdgpu) - connected to DP-1 kernel: vfio-pci.ids=&lt;...&gt; nvidia-drm.modeset=0 nouveau.modeset=0 modprobe.blacklist=nouveau,nvidia,nvidia_uvm,nvidia_drm,nvidia_modeset UEFI Primary display: card 2 </code></pre> <p>This worked fine and when my bootloader loaded the arch EFI entry, the display would be on card 2.</p> <p>However I&#39;ve recently swapped out card one for another AMD card (which i&#39;ve bound instead to vfio-pci), however whenever loading the arch EFI entry, it will default to card 1 and load the framebuffer onto it. It naturally wont load Xorg as the driver is bound to vfio-pci. I don&#39;t get any output on card 2 once UEFI has handed over to the arch EFI image.</p> <p>How can I force the early arch boot process to use card 2 and ignore card 1? </p> <p>I tried setting video=DP-1:e in the kernel cmd line as per <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_mode_setting">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_mode_setting</a> but it did not help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/allocx"> /u/allocx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcbyda/how_to_set_primary_display_in_early_boot_process/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcbyda/how_to_set_primary_display_in_early_boot_process/">[comments]</a></span>
