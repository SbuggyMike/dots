<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I lack proper English grammar and the knowledge of any terms used to described classical music. I am just a normal listener.</p> <p>However I felt the need to express how I feel about this piece and eventually ask for something similar to listen to.</p> <p>I love it , I cant survive mentally without listening to it 2 times a day. I think I am addicted to this piece (drama aside). The second &amp; last movement (favorites) are so explosive it makes me want to break everything in my house! It fuels me with so much adrenaline , it is so overwhelming.</p> <p>I have been listening to that symphony for 2 months straight almost every day , and it seems difficult to get used to it :|</p> <p>I have discovered plenty emotional &amp; epic &amp; explosive stuff , however this particular symphony has something more than the others , I cant describe it...</p> <p>Same feelings I get from Bruckner&#39;s 8th , Mahler&#39;s 2nd. Their first movement , has that lovely climax at the end , it gets me to heavens.</p> <p>So I ask , is there something similar (obviously not identical) to it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/emmidkwhat"> /u/emmidkwhat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wc484b/heavily_obsessed_with_shostakovich_11th/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wc484b/heavily_obsessed_with_shostakovich_11th/">[comments]</a></span>
