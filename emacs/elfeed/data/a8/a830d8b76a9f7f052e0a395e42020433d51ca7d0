<p>“Iosevka Comfy” is the name of my collection of custom typefaces,
derived <a href="https://github.com/be5invis/iosevka">from Iosevka</a>.  It
addresses the pain points (however small) I have had with all other
libre fonts, including Hack, Source Code Pro, Fira Mono/Code, and
upstream Iosevka’s numerous stylistic variants.</p>

<p>My project’s README, describes all the technicalities about the goal of
Iosevka Comfy, its particularities, the multiple build files it
provides, and the differences between them.  The very short description
is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] with a rounded style and open shapes, adjusted metrics, and
overrides for almost all individual glyphs in both roman (upright) and
italic (slanted) variants.</p>

<p>While not specific to Emacs, Iosevka Comfy is an integral part of <em>my
Emacs experience</em>: these are the only fonts I use as they complement my
efforts to have highly legible interfaces that are consistent and devoid
of exaggerations (per my <code>modus-themes</code>).</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Updated the screenshots that compare Iosevka Comfy to regular Iosevka.
They show how the former is more vertically compact than the latter,
while also exhibiting the stylistic differences between the two.  Make
sure to view the images in full screen mode, otherwise the characters
may be distorted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iosevka Comfy comes in “narrow” and “wide” variants.  As the latter
have different requirements, we optimise for them instead of enforcing
a misguided one-size-fits-all.  Concretely, the README explains thus:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deviations from the regular style</p>

  <p>The variants of Iosevka Comfy are subdivided into “narrow” and “wide”.
The former consists of <code>iosevka-comfy</code> and <code>iosevka-comfy-fixed</code>.  The
latter includes <code>iosevka-comfy-wide</code>, <code>iosevka-comfy-wide-fixed</code>, and
the quasi-proportional <code>iosevka-comfy-duo</code>.</p>

  <p>Due to the relaxed spacing requirements and concomitant legibility
considerations, the wide variants have stylistic deviations from their
counterparts.  In detail:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The <code>m</code> character has three legs of equal length, insetad of a shorter
middle leg.  The short middle leg in the narrow variants is necessary
for legibility, especially at small point sizes (otherwise the
character’s legs visually blend into what appears to be a solid
block).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The <code>0</code> has a forward slash that cuts diagonally through the middle of
the circle, connecting the bottom left part to the top right of the
oval shape.  Whereas the narrow variants have a dashed forward slash
which does not connect the two sides as it is positioned inside the
oval shape.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
