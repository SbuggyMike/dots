<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a laptop and when I boot it the bluetooth works just fine but as soon as I close it and reopen it the bluetooth adapter doesn&#39;t get detected anymore. I have the ACPI package, <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager">Optimus Manager</a> and <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtw89-dkms-git">this driver</a> (my system info says I have a Realtek 8852AE module for BT and WLAN) installed. <a href="https://pastebin.com/bhKBkyHR">This</a> is the output of <code>sudo dmesg | grep -i Bluetooth</code>. I have tried to restart the bluetooth service via <code>sudo systemctl restart bluetooth</code> but that didn&#39;t help. Any other ideas? Thanks for reading my post. I also followed the tutorial on the driver&#39;s GitHub telling me to set up a script that unloads the module on suspension and reloads it when waking up again. I also saw <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth#Adapter_disappears_after_suspend/resume">this</a> entry in the arch wiki but since my adapter is connected via PCI this doesn&#39;t work out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Trqhxrd"> /u/Trqhxrd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5ms0f/bluetooth_not_working_after_suspension/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5ms0f/bluetooth_not_working_after_suspension/">[comments]</a></span>
