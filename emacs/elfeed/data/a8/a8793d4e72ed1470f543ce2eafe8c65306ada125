    of Facial Recognition</a> and Other Biometric Technology.*
<p>
I support passing this law, but it does not go far enough.  Nongovernmental
operation of systems for <a href="https://www.stallman.org/notes/2021-nov-feb.html#14_February_2022_(Stopping_Clearview_AI)">facial recognition</a>
                                            (and other 1984 surveillance
systems) is <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">equally dangerous</a>
   and we need to put an end to that too.
