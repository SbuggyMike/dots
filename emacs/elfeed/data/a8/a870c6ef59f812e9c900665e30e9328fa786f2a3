<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Flatpaks can be useful in many circumstances. Like for instance automatic updates for discord, and also discord not stealing your data. But when you start using flatpaks for other apps such as steam, it breaks things, modding doesnâ€™t work, etc. flatpaks are great but should be only used in certain cases. Imo system packages are much superior.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WordGlad"> /u/WordGlad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w0ochl/unpopular_opinion_flatpaks_are_overrated/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w0ochl/unpopular_opinion_flatpaks_are_overrated/">[comments]</a></span>
