<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Out of curiosity, I looked up a celesta price. The CEL-56 has an MSRP of $33,280.00.</p> <p>Another is the harpsichord, which a cursory Google search suggests between $14,000 to $18,000.</p> <p>So that got me wondering: </p> <p>Who buys the more expensive and, perhaps lesser used, instruments?</p> <p>UPDATE: Perhaps a better way to phrase my question: whose responsibility is it to provide expensive instruments for a performance, e.g. a symphony orchestra, but also a chamber group that is being recorded.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FractionalTotality"> /u/FractionalTotality </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8lcyf/who_buys_the_celesta/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8lcyf/who_buys_the_celesta/">[comments]</a></span>
