<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context: I work in healthcare and I see the sharp end of the stick in terms of how dependent old age can render you, so I may be somewhat of a doomsayer. I&#39;m also not from a background where I&#39;m expecting any inheritence, before anyone accuses me of selfish intentions. </p> <p>Every day at work, I&#39;m seeing people in various states of self-neglect, inability to cope, and unsafe conditions- and those are just the ones who are reasonably healthy for their age. </p> <p>Over the past 50 years, our society has radically shifted in how it cares for it&#39;s elderly and for how long- if someone spends 50 years of their adult life working and then a subsequent 20 years of their adult life being cared for with varying degrees of round the clock care, it&#39;s difficult to see how society can actually support this. </p> <p>If you don&#39;t have a social safety net, then care for these people requires family to chip in and takes people out of work and society to do so. If you do have a social safety net, caring for one person for a week probably takes about 6-7 people&#39;s worth of round the clock work (other people&#39;s family members). </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>This is on a background of no-one saving enough pension to fund all this anyway, and if the state picks up the bill we&#39;re turning it into a ponzi scheme where we need to sap all the benefits and growth from the youth to pay for our current elderly, via care-homes and services. </p> <p>As an example, previous to our aging population the wealth transfer would look something like this: </p> <p>Old person becomes infirm, relatives move in and share wealth, old person dies relatively soon, family inherit remainder. </p> <p>Whereas in our currently evolving system it looks more like:<br/> Old person becomes infirm, state and care services bleed away all assets, old person remains alive due to medical advances, old person runs out of assets, state picks up the difference, family left with little to nothing, or if they have contributed for better care, worse off than when they started. </p> <p>Where is that going to leave the next generation? It seems obvious to me that the entire system is broken and getting worse. </p> <p>The only thing I can see touching this problem is mass care homes. Either that, or a combination of a cure for dementia + adding 5 years to the pension age. </p> <p>So what does ukpolitics think the answer should be?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vagus-Stranger"> /u/Vagus-Stranger </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/whqm3j/how_on_earth_do_we_solve_the_aging_population/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/whqm3j/how_on_earth_do_we_solve_the_aging_population/">[comments]</a></span>
