<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Games are 90+30inc. I came in prepared with some opening lines to pursue, though got my move order wrong and lost a pawn a bit early in a Sicilian. (Reminder 1: Chess happens in stages, with development typically first. Unless you see something decisive or forced about getting in d5, build up your position before playing it)</p> <p>I chose to lose it in a way that kept the bishop pair on an open board, though as it turns out, had I calculated one move further, I could have poisoned the pawn with a fork response if defended a different way. (Reminder 2: The Q8-a5 diagonal is one of your weapons in the Sicilian. Always check it with activity on the E file.)</p> <p>He made a few defensive moves with his king because I threatened a few discoveries on the open board using my bishops as the revealers. And suddenly he had a hard time really moving around, so opted to set up a discovery check of his own, if I captured a piece first. I literally ruled it out in three seconds because discovery check scares me, but it was just a free piece. (Reminder 3: Assume nothing. Calculate everything as far as you can, covering checks captures, threats, and development.)</p> <p>Instead I found a plan to win my pawn back and give us same color bishops, while also splitting his pair of pawns while mine stayed connected, so I went for that. (Reminder 4: See a good move? Check for a better one.)</p> <p>There was an added benefit to going this route; he saw a chance at checkmate and moved in with his Qh5 (bishop pointed at h7 already), also forking my bishop on e5. But he didn’t see f5, stopping both attacks, which I played. (Special note: I didn’t realize f5 was good until it was his turn. My calculation had not gone this far. I panicked my way into finding it.)</p> <p>From here I had a slightly better bishop and pawn structure, so I set out to trade both rooks (did successfully), while keeping my bishop alive, since my pawns had his bishop penned in. This was successful, but that earlier f5 exposed my king and I had to sweat some checks. (Special note: Trust your gut. He offered a draw at one point but I declined)</p> <p>I dreamed of my queen being on a certain square and worked her way there, forcing pressure and eventually a blunder, he had to sack his bishop to avoid mate, and resigned a few moves later. </p> <p>I reviewed the game after and found two huge errors of inaccurate thinking; it’s embarrassing honestly, I don’t think I want to share the actual game. But I’ve got two tomorrow so hoping to do better with the white pieces.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dbixon"> /u/dbixon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/139dde8/i_am_rated_roughly_2100_on_lichess_blitz_and_just/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/139dde8/i_am_rated_roughly_2100_on_lichess_blitz_and_just/">[comments]</a></span>
