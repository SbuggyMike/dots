Some time ago I mentioned that I started doing “weekly reviews” of what I have done last week and what I am going in the next week. One part of my weekly reviews is checking how much time I spent doing various things last week. Of course, Org mode clock tables are an excellent tool for that. There is one caveat, though. What does “a week” mean? It turns out that it is not obvious at all. The main problem here is the :wstart parameter, telling what day is the first day of the week.
