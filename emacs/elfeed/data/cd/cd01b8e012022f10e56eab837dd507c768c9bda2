China responded to Pelosi's visit to Taiwan with the typical bluster
with which it tries to pressure other countries not to support Taiwan,
and the

<p>
These are the way China tries to intimidate and threaten.  If we don't
want to let China conquer Taiwan, we must not be influenced by China's
pressure.

China is a real military threat, but that's not due to Pelosi's visit,
and Pelosi could not have made China less of a real threat by staying
away from Taiwan.  We cannot defend Taiwan from China's military power
by tiptoeing.
