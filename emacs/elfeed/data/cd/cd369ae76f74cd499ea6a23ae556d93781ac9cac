Big US railroads gave paid sick leave to some unions,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/01/railroad-workers-union-win-sick-leave">mainly the ones whose workers don't do the day-to-day
  operation of the trains.</a>
  This is not adequate.

If railroads want their workers to work even when sick, they are
trying to exploit those workers.
