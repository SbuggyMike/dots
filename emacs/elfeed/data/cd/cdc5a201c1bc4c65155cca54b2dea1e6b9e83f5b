<p>&#8216;Mr and Mrs B began attending the religious services of the Barry Congregation of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses in 1984. They made lots of friends in the congregation, among whom were Mark Sewell, his wife Mary and their children. Mark Sewell was an elder; however, he began drinking heavily and behaving inappropriately towards female members of the congregation, for example by kissing them on the lips when he greeted them. In 1990, he raped Mrs B after they had been out evangelising together and in 2014 he was convicted of her rape and of indecently assaulting two other people.&#8217;</p>
