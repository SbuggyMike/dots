<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using Arch Linux for almost 2.5 years now, and installing Arch Linux was never been this easy and <em>perfect</em>, cause every time I do a fresh install, it takes a reasonable amount of time and effort and I might certainly miss something as I do everything manually (some personal preferences that are not listed on the official Installation guide). Now, the archinstalll script can do all what I can, but <em>better.</em></p> <p>I might even start recommend it to the beginners who are willing to use Arch Linux as I think it&#39;s mature enough.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/1_7xr"> /u/1_7xr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w9rp0z/the_archinstall_script_is_just_amazing_i_love_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w9rp0z/the_archinstall_script_is_just_amazing_i_love_it/">[comments]</a></span>
