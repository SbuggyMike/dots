<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>FIDE has released their August rating list here: <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/">https://ratings.fide.com/</a></p> <p>As you can see, we have a new player officially above 2700: Congratulations to GM Sanan Sjugirov, who at 29 years old breaks the barrier for the first time. GM Vladislav Artemiev is also back above 2700, while GM Alexei Shirov falls below 2700 again.</p> <p>Of course with the Olympiad there is a lot of movements in these rankings: Shirov is already back above 2700 in live ratings, as well as GM Deac and Gukesh, who look to keep their rating for an official FIDE-list for the first time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdVSC2"> /u/AdVSC2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wddpms/august_fide_elo_list_released_new_2700club_member/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wddpms/august_fide_elo_list_released_new_2700club_member/">[comments]</a></span>
