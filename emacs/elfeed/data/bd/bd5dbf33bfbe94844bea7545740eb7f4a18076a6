<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I always wondered If there&#39;s a rule or tradition that demand&#39;s that a soloist has to be standing up in front of the orchestra while playing the piece, because if I was a soloist myself (will never happen of course) I would be very tired of this.</p> <p>Of course we have pianists, cellists, classical guitarrists and (the main reason I&#39;m writing this post) the marvelous Itzhak Perlman who has a mobility problem due to polio and because of this play sitting up. I just though why any other soloist just grab a chair and plays sitting up too. It would be more confortable, in my mind.</p> <p>I think maybe for wind soloists playing standing up can bÃª more easy to their &quot;air dynamics&quot; (don&#39;t know how to say It, you guys get it) but thats it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adorable_Leg8753"> /u/Adorable_Leg8753 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wik4h1/soloists_playing_sitting_down/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wik4h1/soloists_playing_sitting_down/">[comments]</a></span>
