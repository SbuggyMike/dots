<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed over the past few days that I was getting unusually high idle CPU temps (around 60 C). Temps would go up to around 65-75 C when playing a game (like Minecraft for instance). My CPU normally idled at around 35-45 C, and I haven&#39;t had this issue (or noticed it) until today when I noticed my CPU temps were idling at around 60 C. I had initially thought it was my messed up fan curve, since I had just updated my BIOS. Today though, I instead went into KSysGuard (using KDE) to see what was using so much CPU power and saw 6% of my CPU usage going to wireplumber. After killing wireplumber my CPU temps then plummeted to around 40-45 C. What gives? Is this a memory leak of sorts? Pipewire-media-session no longer works as a substitute unfortunately (and if it does, it doesn&#39;t work OOTB when re-installing it like it previously did).</p> <p>If wireplumber is the culprit, which it seems like it is, do any development versions fix this bug? If not, are there any working alternatives?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/toast_ghost12"> /u/toast_ghost12 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcj3ko/wireplumber_high_cpu_use_for_seemingly_no_reason/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcj3ko/wireplumber_high_cpu_use_for_seemingly_no_reason/">[comments]</a></span>
