A woman is suing the only pharmacy within 50 miles of her home for
refusing to fill a prescription for contraception

Such situations are likely to arise in the depopulated rural parts of
the US, where stores of any kind are few and far between, and
anti-abortion fanatics are numerous.

I am suspicious of any pharmacy business that gives its individual
staff the privilege to veto a prescription.  No supermarket would
tolerate a sales clerk who refused to sell certain products &mdash; if you
won't do the whole job, you would need to find some other job.  I
suspect that the owners or managers of those pharmacies are themselves
anti-abortion fanatics, and that letting staff veto prescriptions is a
intentional deniable way of attacking abortion and birth
contraception while denying their responsibility in the matter.

It's clear that any pharmacy, when open for business, must be legally
required to fill any valid prescription presented by anyone.
