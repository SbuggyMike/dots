<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use <code>ace-jump-char-mode</code> (when I do an isearch for just one char) and also <code>ace-jump-line-mode</code> (which I&#39;ve bound to <code>C-spc</code>). However, often enough to have made &quot;undo&quot; a part of my muscle memory after using those, it seems to be behaving like <code>ace-jump-zap-to-char</code> by cutting everything in between. I use the zap command, but I am not confusing it with the other two here.</p> <p>This has been going on for a while (at least through three iterations of my OS), but I am finally getting around to reporting it. Note that the ace-jump libraries haven&#39;t been changed for 8 years, so lib issues can&#39;t be a problem.
