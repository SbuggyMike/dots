<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi.</p> <p>There&#39;s a good chance I&#39;ll be spectating Grand Chess Tour Blitz section in Warsaw next week. I wanted to obtain some autographs and/or photos. Has anyone been to an event like this and could share their experience concerning meeting the players? Do they have some organised meetups where you can have a quick chat with them? Do they interact with the fans at all? </p> <p>Thanks in advance for any answers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/M4GICK"> /u/M4GICK </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jfl99/asking_for_autographs_and_photos_during_top/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jfl99/asking_for_autographs_and_photos_during_top/">[comments]</a></span>
