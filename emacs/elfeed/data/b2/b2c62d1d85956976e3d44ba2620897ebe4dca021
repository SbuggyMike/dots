<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey y&#39;all, I&#39;ve been running Arch for around a year now (switched from Win), and I&#39;ve realized that I don&#39;t know what my system is anymore. I don&#39;t know what packages I&#39;ve installed, what config files I&#39;ve edited, etc... My system is a pile of spaghetti. This is clearly not sustainable in the long term; something will eventually fail and I won&#39;t be able to reproduce my system. </p> <p>What tools and methods do all of you use to keep track of your systems? What are the best practices and such? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Awerick"> /u/Awerick </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w47fek/system_control/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w47fek/system_control/">[comments]</a></span>
