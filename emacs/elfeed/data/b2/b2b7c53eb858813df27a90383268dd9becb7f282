<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! </p> <p>Big release from HuggingFace this week. They released a large, language model for code (<a href="https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder">https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder</a>). It has 15.5B parameters, 8192 context window, it was trained on permissively licensed code. Looks like it&#39;s the best open alternative for copilot.</p> <p>There is also a VSCode extension <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HuggingFace.huggingface-vscode">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HuggingFace.huggingface-vscode</a> </p> <p>Nothing for Emacs, but I think adding it would not be that hard (the above extension itself is a fork of a TabNine extension). </p> <p>Semi-related interesting post <a href="https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html#reverse-engineering-preview">https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html#reverse-engineering-preview</a> on reverse engineering the copilot extension (how it prompts the LLM to add context about your project). Might be useful to add to the Emacs extension.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_puhsu"> /u/_puhsu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138f8nl/open_copilot_alternative/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138f8nl/open_copilot_alternative/">[comments]</a></span>
