<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just got a NanoPi R5S for eventual use as a home automation server (and potentially as a router and VPN server). It has a Rockchip RK3568B2 ARM Cortex-A55n ARM processor. I am struggling with what OS to put on it. Obviously I cannot put Arch proper on it because it is an ARM architecture, but I really like Arch because the packages tend to be up to date and it is easy to package new software and add it to a local repository. My only experience with ARM devices are some old Raspberry Pis running Raspbian and a couple of old routers running OpenWrt. Most of my x86 systems run Arch although I have to support a couple of sytems that run Debian. </p> <p>I guess I am thinking between Debian, Arch and OpenWRT. What distro would you choose?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AppointmentNearby161"> /u/AppointmentNearby161 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbj83v/arch_for_arm_or_a_different_distro/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbj83v/arch_for_arm_or_a_different_distro/">[comments]</a></span>
