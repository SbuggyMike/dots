<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has any of you managed to get HTML completion with Corfu? CSS files seem to auto-complete fine for me but HTML files don&#39;t. I have the &quot;web mode&quot; package installed and enabled even though I don&#39;t think Corfu uses that for auto-completion like Company does. Beside Corfu I have the cape package installed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zoliky"> /u/zoliky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf4a0f/html_completion_with_corfu/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf4a0f/html_completion_with_corfu/">[comments]</a></span>
