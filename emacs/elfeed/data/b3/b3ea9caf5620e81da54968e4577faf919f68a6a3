<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry if this is dumb question. I&#39;m an American, getting into Cricket and I am just curious. How do Cricket fans who live in places where matches are broadcast routinely (sadly not in the US) enjoy the match?</p> <p>By &#39;how&#39;, I don&#39;t mean TV vs Streaming or something like that. What I mean is, say there is a Test match scheduled for your team. The match is going to last at least 3 or 4 days at least, sometimes 5, right? I&#39;m assuming you all have jobs and families and wives with honeydew lists lol. I just can&#39;t imagine how anybody could have time to watch a complete ODI match let alone a Test match. So what is a typical way for you to enjoy the match? Do you just tune in for an hour or two at a time when you can? Only tune in when it looks like the match is ending to see if your team can pull it out? Just watch the highlights on a sports channels at the end of the day? Let&#39;s say part of the match is being played on a Saturday or Sunday. Would it be typical to say to your friends, come on over this afternoon and we&#39;ll watch &#39;some&#39; of the match? </p> <p>For T20 I don&#39;t think this question really applies since it seems like those matches are in manageable chunks of 3 hours or so right? So I&#39;d expect people would watch those just like any other sporting event, like football, American football, basketball, baseball, etc. But ODI and Test matches in Cricket are a totally different beast. I can&#39;t think of any other sport where a single match takes as much time to complete.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/framptal_tromwibbler"> /u/framptal_tromwibbler </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w93mo8/how_do_cricket_fans_watch_test_and_odi_matches/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w93mo8/how_do_cricket_fans_watch_test_and_odi_matches/">[comments]</a></span>
