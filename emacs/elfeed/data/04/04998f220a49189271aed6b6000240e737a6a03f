New York State has <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/new-york-state-budget-passes-with-first-statewide-fossil-fuel-ban-on-new-construction">prohibited building new buildings to use fossil
    fuels</a>.
<p>
The same law allocates funds to convert some old buildings to use
electricity instead.

This will result in substantial reductions in fossil fuel use,
provided the state builds enough renewable generating capacity
to feed the resulting higher demand for electricity.
