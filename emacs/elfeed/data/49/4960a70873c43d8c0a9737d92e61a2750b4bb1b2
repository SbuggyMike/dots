<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Most people that have invested the time to get comfortable with track-points, the red dot that Lenovo or Dell laptops have in the middle of their keyboard, will tell you that it&#39;s one of the best input devices they&#39;ve used. However, not all laptops have a track-point and it&#39;s great not leaving home row in order to move the cursor. Is it possible to move the cursor using the keyboard, for example by pressing and holding hjkl, in the same way that a trackpad or trackpoint would move?</p> <p>I&#39;m aware of [1]. However I would like to move the cursor in the traditional way rather than binary searching my monitor space.</p> <p>Has anyone tinkered with something like this? Any guidance before moving on to X mailing list, reading the docs and butchering [1]? Thanks!</p> <p>[1]: <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/keynav">https://github.com/jordansissel/keynav</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hjklplayer"> /u/hjklplayer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg4t1w/move_cursor_with_hjkl/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg4t1w/move_cursor_with_hjkl/">[comments]</a></span>
