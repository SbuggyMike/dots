<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I made a USB drive for disk recovery and just to have a portable desktop. I still have a 32GB NTFS partition on the drive so I can use it as a regular USB to move data. Is there any way I can try to hide the Linux partitions on windows systems?</p> <p>I have tried to set the partition flags <code>diag</code>, <code>hidden</code> and <code>msftres</code> in various combinations but that did not work out. <code>msftres</code> hides the partition in the disk management tool of windows but not in the file explorer. I need a solution that isn&#39;t bound to one windows installation and has to be set up on the next one as well. I need something that hides my partitions no matter in which device I plug the drive in.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Trqhxrd"> /u/Trqhxrd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb4zye/how_can_i_hide_a_linux_partition_in_windows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wb4zye/how_can_i_hide_a_linux_partition_in_windows/">[comments]</a></span>
