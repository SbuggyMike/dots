<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I’m planning on going to a 30 classical time format event in Salt Lake City. I’m unrated and will be playing in the lost rated u1000ish section. Any tips? Plan on mostly just trying to memorize basic pawn endgames. 4+3 3+2 type stuff and not really worry about results, as this is my first tournament and I’m kind of planning on entering it on a whim.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Curious-Ad-8382"> /u/Curious-Ad-8382 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/whg3l2/tips_for_first_tournament/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/whg3l2/tips_for_first_tournament/">[comments]</a></span>
