<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi so I recently came across a cool project called Linux From Scratch which essentially is a step by step guide how to build your own minimal Linux “Distro”. </p> <p>I have allot of free time right now and think this will be a fun project to work on. Anyone here that has done this project in the past and can recommend if this is a good way to learn how Linux works from a service level? </p> <p>I always wanted to create/have a minimal Linux based operation system without a package manager which allows you to compile binaries to use in a tty interface. I don’t even want a GUI interface (maybe support for X window system to run OpenGL applications in full screen, but thats about it, don’t need things like a window manager etc) </p> <p>Is this a doable project for 4/6 month’s time for someone who has an C/C++ embedded and networking background? Or is this much more complicated than I initially think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/k3rn4l-p4n1c"> /u/k3rn4l-p4n1c </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wcwyng/is_lfs_linux_from_scratch_a_good_way_to_learn_how/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wcwyng/is_lfs_linux_from_scratch_a_good_way_to_learn_how/">[comments]</a></span>
