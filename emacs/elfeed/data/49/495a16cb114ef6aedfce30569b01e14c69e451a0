<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With elisp it is possible to add overlays to parts of the buffer to hide them etc. I went through all the possible overlays and couldn&#39;t find a way to pin a selection. Is it possible to have a function that, given a selection in a buffer, pins this selection so that when you scroll up or down the selection is always shown? (a bit like what you have with Excel where you can lock some rows or columns so that they always appear on screen).</p> <p>I wanted to do something like this but with <code>(overlay-put new-overlay &#39;lock t)</code> but there doesn&#39;t appear to be such overlay.</p> <p><code>elisp (defun hide-region-hide () &quot;Hides a region by making an invisible overlay over it and save the overlay on the hide-region-overlays \&quot;ring\&quot;&quot; (interactive) (let ((new-overlay (make-overlay (mark) (point)))) (push new-overlay hide-region-overlays) (overlay-put new-overlay &#39;invisible t) (overlay-put new-overlay &#39;intangible t) (overlay-put new-overlay &#39;before-string (if hide-region-propertize-markers (propertize hide-region-before-string &#39;font-lock-face &#39;hide-region-before-string-face) hide-region-before-string)) (overlay-put new-overlay &#39;after-string (if hide-region-propertize-markers (propertize hide-region-after-string &#39;font-lock-face &#39;hide-region-after-string-face) hide-region-after-string)))) </code></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MonsieurPi"> /u/MonsieurPi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wddq61/how_to_pinlockfix_text/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wddq61/how_to_pinlockfix_text/">[comments]</a></span>
