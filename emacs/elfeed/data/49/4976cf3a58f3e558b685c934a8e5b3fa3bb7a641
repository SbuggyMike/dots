<p>I'll give just one example. A few weeks ago I took my baby to the doctor for a routine exam, which includes weighing.<p>Scales are an ancient, pretty straightforward technology. If a skilled craftsman built a scale 300 years ago and it was well maintained over the centuries, I think its reasonable to expect it to still work adequately, and a minimally trained person would be able to operate it.<p>However, this electronic scale was so complicated and full of gadgetry (including bluetooth) that the hospital staff were unable to weigh my child and we had to go back home and reschedule.<p>I can think of a million other examples (Juicero...) but I'm more curious to hear of real-life examples like the one I shared.</p>
