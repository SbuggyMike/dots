<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I grew up on Gentoo (believe it or not -- it&#39;s irrelevant if not) through a Gentoo desktop dev I met at a local computer shop way back in the day named tseng. I didn&#39;t distro hop until much later in life when I started playing with Ubuntu and found it convenient. I hopped through all the usual hoops, landed on Arch, then grew tired of computing (engineer by day) and switched to Windows for gaming and convenience.</p> <p>I&#39;m circling back to Arch after having messed with my Steam Deck now for a while and feeling that itch to scratch -- I&#39;ve a question that I asked myself back then and am asking myself again now that I can&#39;t find having been asked (at least recently) here, so prepare yourself for what may be one of the most stupidest questions I feel like I can ask after the length of time I&#39;ve used Linux prior.</p> <p>With Gentoo it&#39;s easy to trust the packages I&#39;m installing as portage is grabbing the source tar and I can compare that with what&#39;s in the upstream repo. When pacman is installing a binary, though, I can&#39;t in my mind establish how you&#39;d verify that the source wasn&#39;t tampered with before compile. On the one hand I feel if something like that happened it&#39;d be shouted loudly across the ether, but on the other hand, *how do we know*?</p> <p>Thanks for listening to a middle-aged has-been talk about his musings regarding to come back from the technological grave into relevance.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>EDIT: To be clear, I&#39;ve read <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/security#Authentication">the Arch Wiki article</a> concerning security and I&#39;m aware of the trust web with signing keys that&#39;s in place -- my speculation is concerning the &quot;what if&quot; regarding the hypothetical scenario of Arch maintainers wanting to modify a core package to embed, say, data collection without making us aware (a la Ubuntu), and how we&#39;d know that hasn&#39;t happened with the binaries. I&#39;m asking what mechanisms are in place to prevent that from happening and how we go about auditing binary packages to verify that fact.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dare2094"> /u/Dare2094 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfexif/noob_question_binary_package_trust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfexif/noob_question_binary_package_trust/">[comments]</a></span>
