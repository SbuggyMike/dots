<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to rebuild the aur package ros-noetic-desktop-full with yay from source (rebuild after dependencies have updated).</p> <p><code>yay -S ros-noetic-desktop-full --rebuildtree</code></p> <p>But it aborts with error 429 (i assume ratelimit) and a random number of downloaded packages (10 to 100) (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/n4ITl1y">See here, after some successful packages the progress goes from (X/83) to (0/83)</a>).</p> <p>I heard that there is an 4000 requests/day limit on the aur but then the ~260 packages for ros should be fine (now less because i think i slowly gather all packages by retrying).</p> <p>I was unable to find any directly related question on the internet and no possible cause of this behavior. Might there be a custom ratelimit on each aur hoster (minutely)? (I tried with different hosts all around the world)</p> <p>I want to manage the ros packages with yay, is there another way to download the ros-packages while still keep the yay package management?</p> <p>In summary i tried:</p> <ul> <li>yay setting requestsplitn with different values</li> <li>different aur hoster</li> <li>different days</li> <li>pacman parallel downloads off (dont think this affects yay)</li> <li>different networks</li> </ul> <p>(This is my first question on reddit, i hope this is not a bad question :) )</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LeopardFuzzy"> /u/LeopardFuzzy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w56khw/how_does_the_ratelimit_or_error_429_in_the_aur/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w56khw/how_does_the_ratelimit_or_error_429_in_the_aur/">[comments]</a></span>
