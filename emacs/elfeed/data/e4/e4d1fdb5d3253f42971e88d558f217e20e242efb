<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I only started using emacs a few days ago, but after getting over hating it for the first day or two, I learned how to do basic things from memory, like install packages, open text files, and use custom themes. I&#39;m a fan now.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to set it up to do the sorts or things an IDE would do, but the way I&#39;m doing it doesn&#39;t quite have the functionality I&#39;m looking for.</p> <p>Currently what I&#39;m doing is opening a buffer with a text file, saving it as &quot;somefile.c&quot; (because I mainly work in C), and using the C major mode by typing &quot;M-x c-mode.&quot; That implements syntax highlighting, which is nice, but there&#39;s a few things it doesn&#39;t do that I&#39;d like it to do:</p> <ul> <li><p>debugging/error correction - At the moment, if I type something like</p> <pre><code> # include &lt;stdio.h </code></pre></li> </ul> <p>it doesn&#39;t notice my dumb typo, and I&#39;d prefer if it had some kind of feature to tell me what was wrong, rather than just getting a compilation error when I try to compile it. </p> <ul> <li>real time terminal - Ideally, I&#39;d like to open a window with a separate buffer containing a terminal emulator so that I can compile+execute the code within emacs. </li> </ul> <p>Also, if anyone has configured their emacs so that it can be used as an IDE and has found some features helpful, I&#39;d be interested in hearing about them!</p> <p>(N.B. I also work in Haskell. I&#39;m having similar issues with the Haskell mode that I&#39;m having with the C mode)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RepresentativePop"> /u/RepresentativePop </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whvvpg/n00b_question_how_can_i_use_emacs_as_an_ide_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whvvpg/n00b_question_how_can_i_use_emacs_as_an_ide_for/">[comments]</a></span>
