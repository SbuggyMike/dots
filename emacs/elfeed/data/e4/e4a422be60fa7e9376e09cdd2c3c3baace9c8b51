<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>Arch has been running quite smoothly on my Razer Blade 15 for a few months now. Until this point I&#39;ve only used the laptop&#39;s built-in display, but now I&#39;m trying to connect an external monitor and I&#39;m getting some really bad results. It looks like there are only 8 colors on the external display. AFAIK, the HDMI and Thunderbolt 3 ports are both directly connected to the NVIDIA graphics card, so they shouldn&#39;t be going through the onboard intel graphics card. I&#39;m using the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. Any ideas on why this is happening?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HeyCanIBorrowThat"> /u/HeyCanIBorrowThat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wecewn/distorted_colors_when_connecting_external_display/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wecewn/distorted_colors_when_connecting_external_display/">[comments]</a></span>
