<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Came across this issue while trying to install Arch in a VM today, occurred with any .iso file I tried to use, downloaded through http or torrented, they had the same issue; I was unable to install because the keyring was &#39;corrupted&#39;. Here&#39;s a fix for those who were in my situation:</p> <ol> <li>edit the /etc/pacman.conf file on the .iso (vim or nano)</li> <li>change the parameters of &quot;SigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional&quot; to &quot;SigLevel = TrustAll&quot;</li> <li>save and quit</li> <li>update repositories and install archlinux-keyring (pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring)</li> <li>run &quot;pacman-key --init&quot;</li> <li>run &quot;pacman-key --populate&quot;</li> <li>(optional) change SigLevel back to its default parameters</li> </ol> <p>and ta-da! now you can install arch! This worked with archinstall, idk if anyone else has this issue, lemme know if it helps!</p> <p>edit : fixed the order of things</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/juniperrrrrrrrr"> /u/juniperrrrrrrrr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wgevbw/unable_to_install_arch_with_07012022_iso_requires/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wgevbw/unable_to_install_arch_with_07012022_iso_requires/">[comments]</a></span>
