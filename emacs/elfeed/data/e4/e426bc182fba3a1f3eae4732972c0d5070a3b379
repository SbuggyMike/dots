<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Data-at-rest_encryption">Arch Wiki</a> mentions that only encrypting the home partition has the drawbacks of leaving potential sensitive information in other directories on the system like <code>/tmp</code>, or <code>/var</code>, but it doesn&#39;t elaborate much. I&#39;m curious what types of data are at risk if one only encrypts the home partition.</p> <h2>Aside</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13jq58a/what_root_directories_should_be_encrypted_on_a/">This post</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/13jq4sd/what_root_directories_should_be_encrypted_on_a/">this post</a> are related to this, however, I felt that those posts were poorly thought out, and their target information was not made clear enough.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Izerpizer"> /u/Izerpizer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13jtg4i/what_sensitive_data_do_i_risk_if_i_only_encrypt/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13jtg4i/what_sensitive_data_do_i_risk_if_i_only_encrypt/">[comments]</a></span>
