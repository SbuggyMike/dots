Australia is planning to punish
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/09/obsession-sleep-harm-drivers-legal-sleep-limit">drivers who did not get enough sleep</a>.
   This is absurd &mdash; people cannot make themselves sleep more, and people
can't wait a day because of being tired.
<p>
As the article explains, the demands on many people don't let them
sleep enough.  To punish them for the consequences of the demands
placed on them is unjust.
<p>
On the other hand. to stop the employers from overworking drivers
could be useful and just.  This requires a fine, not on drivers, but
on their employers.
<p>
It won't be trivial to stop the employers from turning this around
into an excuse to impose more cruelty on drivers.
