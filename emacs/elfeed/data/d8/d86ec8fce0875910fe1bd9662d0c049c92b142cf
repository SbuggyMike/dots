<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;ve been using Arch for almost a year now and I&#39;ve been always curious how other people maintain their system so it doesn&#39;t break. Arch made me reinstall or distrohop many times but I still somehow came back to it. Excluding daily usage of <code>pacman -Syu</code>, what else do you do to maintain your system? How do you achieve to not break it? </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DominiCzech"> /u/DominiCzech </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3z4wh/how_do_you_maintain_your_arch_linux_system/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3z4wh/how_do_you_maintain_your_arch_linux_system/">[comments]</a></span>
