The target of 200 while not a substantial one was still a tough ask against the trio of Wood,Archer and Anderson on a day 5 pitch but Windies achieved the target thanks to an unbeaten 95 from Jermaine Blackwood.</p> <p>Roughly 4 weeks later, England chased down a target of 277 against Pakistan after being 117/5, thanks to a 139 run stand b/w Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 1 - Gabba &amp; Sydney :</strong> </li> </ul> <p>In January 2021, A weakened Indian team, chasing a target of 408 against Australia were 250/3 with almost two session to go but dismissals of Rishabh Pant and Pujara along with an injury to Jadeja, Vihari &amp; Ashwin meant they had to fight for the draw, ending with 334/5 when the game ended, leaving a lot of people wondering whether the target could be achieved if had at least 1-2 healthier batter at the crease.</p> <p>A week later, India actually chased down the target of 328 at Gabba,Brisbane. The interesting thing about the game was how Australia(33 runs ahead after the first digs) in the third innings were aware of how no team had ever chased a total more than 246 at Gabba that combined with the fact that there was rain on the horizon gave Australian innings a little more urgency. An urgency that India denied to show and played as per their role despite coming with an intent to chase down the total and played the day 5 to the almost entirety and getting more runs on day 5 than Australia did on day 4 despite having a relatively sensible approach with only the usual aggressors being aggressive.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/8ardf6q4cyc91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be8d7be2b666dbb3a14cc42fa1c1b0041617050d">https://preview.redd.it/8ardf6q4cyc91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be8d7be2b666dbb3a14cc42fa1c1b0041617050d</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 2 - Chattogram &amp; Kyle Mayers Magic :</strong></li> </ul> <p>Roughly 3 weeks later, The Windies team chased down the target of 395 on day 5 against Bangladesh thanks to an unbeaten by Kyle Mayers on debut who formed a 216 run alliance with Nkrumah Bonner and a 100 run stand with Joshua Da Silva to scale the Mt Everest for the Windies. Bangladesh on day 4 had a haphazard 3rd innings where only 3 out the 9 batters got to double digits, declaring their innings at 223/8 with a lead of 394 which at that time looked like a match winning one but a certain gentleman named Kyle Mayers had other ideas.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/x7uj6fe9cyc91.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c097ba4ffee68c1722bb1ff611294e9f9d5e4d0">https://preview.redd.it/x7uj6fe9cyc91.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c097ba4ffee68c1722bb1ff611294e9f9d5e4d0</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 3 - The Elgar Resilience &amp; The comeback:</strong> </li> </ul> <p>After being 0-1 in the Series and seeing the retirement of Quinton De Kock from the tests, South Africa defeated India in Johannesburg and Capetown both by 7 wickets,chasing 200+ totals twice with rather ease and supreme control.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/y2xlhcgccyc91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ddd5a9b3df0620e645e4f90e11b413fee2e6ee3">https://preview.redd.it/y2xlhcgccyc91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ddd5a9b3df0620e645e4f90e11b413fee2e6ee3</a></p> <p>Dean Elgar stood like a rock,scoring 96 not out and having smart partnerships for the first 4 wickets to get his team to the target. India on the other hand despite it just being the third day of the game on both the occasions showed an unnecessary level of urgency which the South African bowler used to full effect, inducing edges from the batters with accurate lines and wrapping the third innings quickly in both the game. but most importantly, showed their utmost sensibility when chasing the target of 212 as Keegan Petersen was the anchor this time with his 82 not out.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/kdyq5guqcyc91.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfc7d50dd08672be85d863ebb302970f06e3d59c">https://preview.redd.it/kdyq5guqcyc91.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfc7d50dd08672be85d863ebb302970f06e3d59c</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 4: The Stokes,Root,B-Mac &amp; YJB Quartet:</strong></li> </ul> <p>in June-July of 2022, England after having a horrendous year or so, now under their new test leader Ben Stokes chased down 4 back-to-back targets of 277,299,296 &amp; 378.</p> <p>Starting of with the 1st test at Lord&#39;s, </p> <p>After both teams had a horrendous 1st innings, New Zealand set England the target of 277 which England chased down thanks to a hundred for Joe Root while Sotkes and Foakes contributed 54 &amp; 32 each. New Zealand just like Bangladesh had a haphazard 3rd innings and similarly had only 2 contributions of note with Mitchell &amp; Blundell scoring 108 &amp; 96 respectively which accounted for 71.4% of their team total with 21 being the next best not helped by the fact that Colin de Grandhomme got injured during the game.</p> <p>England on the other hand were sensible after the collapse with Root,Stokes and Foakes taking their time and understood the value of staying on the crease well to get to the target.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/6c8ouq03dyc91.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7593a89ee6159f19e3b666e4ea89a6ccf2ec59ec">https://preview.redd.it/6c8ouq03dyc91.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7593a89ee6159f19e3b666e4ea89a6ccf2ec59ec</a></p> <p>At Nottingham, after again having equally matched 1st innings, New Zealand played decently in the 3rd innings but just like Sussex against Middlesex failed to account for how the pitch was still not showing many demons and England after an initial collapse took the attack to New Zealand with Johnny Bairstow scoring a 92 ball 136 supported by an equally aggressive Ben Stokes and earlier a contribution from Alex Lees chasing down the total of 299 in just 49 overs to win the series.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/hg46t2pycyc91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9351b323714c312e6dd679b8609cc1f62622b112">https://preview.redd.it/hg46t2pycyc91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9351b323714c312e6dd679b8609cc1f62622b112</a></p> <p>At Headingley, again after having very neck &amp; neck first digs, New Zealand suffered another defeat as they after being 125/1 collapsed to 161/5 and after yet another Blundell-Mitchell alliance, lost their last 5 wickets for 52 on yet another pitch that was still good to bat. England matched the pace of their previous chase but in a rather sensible manner with some eccentricities here and there like a reverse sweep over the slips from Joe Root and a blistering 71 off 44 from Johnny Bairstow.</p> <p>At Edgebaston, again after being 132 runs behind in the first innings, England first bowled India out for 245,getting a target of 378 in around 150 overs and again used the sensible approach on yet another case of pitch that was pretty good to bat on, took full on the Indian bowling, chasing down the target of 378 in quick time thanks to big hundreds for Johnny Bairstow who got tons in both the innings and Joe Root While Crawley and Lees chipped in with the 50s early on. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/d9qsih4bdyc91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d270c22734dfdeed6c9c7246ad5dcedc71947e0">https://preview.redd.it/d9qsih4bdyc91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d270c22734dfdeed6c9c7246ad5dcedc71947e0</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 5 - The Babar and Abdullah Show :</strong><br/></li> </ul> <p>On 15th March 2022, Australia set Pakistan the target of 506 in 170 odd overs. With the target being a distant thought Pakistan after being 21/2, started an unbelievable show of resilience as Babar Azam and Abdullah Shafique not only had a 228 run partnership but also played out 87 overs in the process, this was followed by another 115 run stand between Babar and Rizwan that too played 41 overs bringing Pakistan in almost a double digit distance of the target but dismissal of Babar and mini collapse meant Rizwan and the Nauman Ali played out the remaining overs ending only 63 runs away from the target. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/g0hthovgdyc91.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=398a0c8b0c1a22f71962d5e3f3d6bc04fa4e1f91">https://preview.redd.it/g0hthovgdyc91.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=398a0c8b0c1a22f71962d5e3f3d6bc04fa4e1f91</a></p> <p>On 19th July 2022, After previously having neck and neck first digs, Sri Lanka set Pakistan a record target of 342, after a good start and a controversial dismissal of Imam-ul-Haq, It was again a Babar and Abdullah show as the pitch despite having it&#39;s ups and downs had not broken down in any capacity. Abdullah and Babar with all the time on their hand took the safe and sensible approach again, milking the singles and doubles with an odd boundary here and there in a 101 run stand followed by another 75 run stand with Mohammad Rizwan who scored 40, Abdullah despite seeing the team go from 276-3 to 303-6 calmly continued post his hundred, getting the team to the target with ease.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/x9bscgjpdyc91.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37d1493dd09dba627cdffd1dde692c8dacba78dd">https://preview.redd.it/x9bscgjpdyc91.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37d1493dd09dba627cdffd1dde692c8dacba78dd</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Inference</strong> :</li> </ul> <p>while there is a multitude of factors being observed here, there&#39;s a lot to notice especially in England where the last 8 test have seen a lot of runs being scored on day 4 and day 5 just a few including:</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>India series :</strong> A 100 from Root on day 4 of the first test, A 100 run partnership by Rahane-Pujara on day 4 &amp; an 89 run stand by Shami-Bumrah on day 5 respectively of the second test, 100 run stand b/w Pant-Thakur &amp; Hameed-Burns on the 4th day of the 4th test, A 100 run stand between Crawley-Lees on day 4 and 200 run stand b/w Bairstow-Root on day 5 of the 5th test.</li> </ul> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>NZ Series</strong> : 100+ run stand b/w Foakes and Root on day 5 on the first test, b/w Bairstow-Stokes on the day 5 of the second test , b/w Root and Pope on the 4th day of the 3rd test and b/w Root-Bairstow on the 5th day of the 3rd test.</li> </ul> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Conclusion :</strong></li> </ul> <p>The batters have shown great temperament while chasing big targets aided by pitches that stayed true and oppositions who failed to account for the condition of the pitch in their 3rd innings, showing a lot of unnecessary urgency in few cases and several other factors can be a few reasons for the great chases being completed recently but ultimately the biggest factor has to be the temperament the pitches weren&#39;t too bad at Lords or Oval either where England collapsed to their defeats.</p> <p>What do you guys think, please let me know.</p> <p><strong>As Always, it is been a pleasure, Thank you, cheers.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alittlemoreofbrowny"> /u/alittlemoreofbrowny </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w4lw73/big_chases_a_third_dig_dilemma_or_a_consequence/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w4lw73/big_chases_a_third_dig_dilemma_or_a_consequence/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
