  Thousands protested in England <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/05/this-was-just-the-warning-fuel-price-protesters-plan-further-action">against the high cost of living</a>,
  which many people with low incomes cannot afford.
  Sad to say, they misidentified the problem as "high fuel prices",
  which means that their public message is a demand to make fossil fuel
  cheap.  <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-mar-jun.html#30_May_2022_(Planet_roaster_companies_building_carbon_bombs)">That</a> <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2021-nov-feb.html#9_February_2022_(The_pollution_paradox)">way</a> <a href="https://stallman.org/archives//2021-jul-oct.html#6_September_2021_(Big_benefits_from_coal_companies)">lies</a> <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2020-jan-apr.html#17_February_2020_(Deaths_by_toxic_pollution)">death</a>!

  Anyway, it's not only fossil fuel that low-income Britons can't
  afford.  Inflation affects more or less everything.  The right
  solution, to give them enough extra income that they can afford
  their living expenses, will address all of that.

  Naturally, the Tories aim to repress any protest that people will
  notice.  They recently passed new laws to do this.  I wonder how
  many of these protesters supported the Tories for that, while Tory
  repression was aimed at environmentalists.
