<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Microsoft Access has a few virtues, like being a desktop app and rather robust in its ability to customize (by Microsoft standards). At its most basic, it will read from and write to a database, usually through Forms that have been customized to display certain information from a database in a certain layout. And because it works with one source of truth (e.g., it can connect to SQL and PostgreSQL databases), multiplayer data entry and collaboration is more feasible than in a purely plain text method being shared by a syncing service.</p> <p>The problem is, Microsoft Access is one sin shy of being the devil. Itâ€™s proprietary and buggy, and coding in VBA is a nightmare compared to most languages, especially our beloved elisp. Someone said MS Access is the best worst way to make a database program, and I think that sums it up well.</p> <p>I know emacs can interface with SQL databases, but are there any packages that try to accomplish something like Microsoft Access, i.e., rapid application development via forms that display and allow editing certain fields from a database? If not, what would be the best practices in building this functionality?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jMilton13"> /u/jMilton13 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jqldy/emacs_version_of_microsoft_access/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jqldy/emacs_version_of_microsoft_access/">[comments]</a></span>
