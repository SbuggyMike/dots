New York thugs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/01/new-york-street-vendors-arrests-mayor-eric-adams-nypd">violently arrested</a> a beloved saxophone player, injuring
him and damaging his instrument, for playing without authorization in
the subway.

Apparently Night-Mayor Adams has taken the bogus "broken windows"
theory one step further.  Breaking windows is undisputedly wrong,
though not a heinous crime.  Playing music in the subway is merely
against a regulation.

The first lesson is, never vote for an ex-cop for mayor.
