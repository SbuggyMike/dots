<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, Arch noob here. </p> <p>I installed arch linux to use it with Awesome WM. So far everything ok. I need a file manager and have both PCManFM and Ranger installed. In both cases I cannot access some folders, as an error signals me &quot;Error opening directory, permission denied&quot;. From what I&#39;ve read around I think it has to do with politi, but I&#39;m not sure. </p> <p>How can I solve it in your opinion? </p> <p>A thousand thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oscarmonteleone"> /u/oscarmonteleone </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzrmxe/file_manager_and_arch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzrmxe/file_manager_and_arch/">[comments]</a></span>
