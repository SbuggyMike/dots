<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hiiii I’m a violist in HS rn and I’m trying to build my skill bc I want to consider pursuing music in college. But I definitely need to practice a lot more- I want to practice 2-3 hours on a free day, I’m currently doing around a half hour a day. My problem is that I don’t have the attention span or something and I can’t focus on practicing for that long even though I really want to. Any advice on how to make the time pass better so that I can keep my attention high and focused?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/peter_bi-per300"> /u/peter_bi-per300 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wizqxi/need_advice_on_practicing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wizqxi/need_advice_on_practicing/">[comments]</a></span>
