<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I discovered linux for a year and I ever use/test Debian and Ubuntu based distros, actually I use Mx Linux and I am questioning me to switch to Arch Linux because it look much easy than I thought and I think it will be a good experience to improve my skills in Linux, but there is a part of me that think there will be problems to switch to Arch linux. I write this to ask you experiment arch user would recommend me think to do when I install arch or if I should really use arch Linux.</p> <p>Thanks for reading this post and sorry if I made some errors, I&#39;m french and I am learning English.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Naurox_"> /u/Naurox_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whk89g/mx_linux_to_arch_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whk89g/mx_linux_to_arch_linux/">[comments]</a></span>
