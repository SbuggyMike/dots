<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Note : This post is not meant to sh*t on SUSE in any way. I&#39;m actually curious!</p> <p>I had a random thought at work so I wanted to post this question here and see what the opinions are... </p> <p>As a hobbyist, I don&#39;t think I would ruffle too many feathers by saying Canonical and Red Hat are the two biggest and most important entities in the Linux space. Having spent the last year and a bit really diving into Linux, I&#39;ve noticed the Linux space as whole use Ubuntu and Fedora/RHEL as a sort of roadmap/compass. Opinions will vary on who&#39;s more important but I think most will agree that it would be VERY detrimental to Linux as a whole if these two were to cease to exist.</p> <p>That brings me to SUSE. I wanted to know how important the Linux community feels SUSE is to the big picture. Not just within the server or desktop space, but as a whole. If SUSE/OpenSUSE went away, what would the effect(s) be? As someone still relatively new to Linux, I&#39;ve definitely seen SUSE/OpenSUSE mentioned and recommended. But never at the rate Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL, or even Arch Linux is. Why is that? Is it because the community doesn&#39;t consider it a viable option? Is it due to lack or promotion/marketing? Should SUSE even be looked at in the same regard as Canonical and Red Hat in terms of importance?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kantoking0206"> /u/kantoking0206 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/138sb0r/how_important_is_suse_to_linux_as_a_whole/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/138sb0r/how_important_is_suse_to_linux_as_a_whole/">[comments]</a></span>
