<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im running newly installed KDE plasma, on a dual boot with windows. I was able to run it fine until I ran a system update which apparently seems to break things quite often. I am not able to do anything during the boot, and single user mode detects no keyboard, but i can chroot from a USB. I&#39;ve tried any solutions i&#39;ve come across but they didn&#39;t work. I would provide more info or logs, but i am completely new to linux so i have no idea what i would be looking for.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Obama___Gaming"> /u/Obama___Gaming </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbjdg0/boot_stuck_on_ok_reached_target_graphical/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbjdg0/boot_stuck_on_ok_reached_target_graphical/">[comments]</a></span>
