<p>&#8216;By way of observation, the principle set out in Bagum-v-Hafiz [2015] EWCA Civ 801 whereby a beneficiary under a trust of land may effectively buy out the others interests appears to be increasingly applied and it has been recently considered in the Court of Appeal case of In the matter of the Estate of Roger Kingsley sub nom (1) Karim Sophie Kingsley (2) Aaron Richard Playle (as Executors of the Estate of Roger John Kingsley) v Sally Margaret Kingsley [2020] EWCA Civ 297. There, the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal that in a farming partnership case the judge had not been entitled to make an orderforsale at a court-assessed price rather than ordering a sale on the open market. Unlike a trustee, the court was not required to get the best price for the property. The Court rejected the notion that Bagum required some sort of valuation threshold to be overcome. On the contrary, Bagum was authority for the proposition that valuation (and the risk that the court-assessed value would not necessarily be the same as the price in an open market sale) was clearly a discretionary matter.&#8217;</p>
