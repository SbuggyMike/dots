<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Around 3 months ago, my mom&#39;s Windows laptop had a failed update, and would no longer start.</p> <p>I&#39;ve always vouched for Linux user-friendliness to my friends, so I decided to practice what I preach, and gave her Linux instead. </p> <p>The setup I did, and the things I manually configured post-install:</p> <ul> <li>Linux Mint LTS with Cinnamon</li> <li>Turned on auto-updates</li> <li>Installed Solitaire and placed it on her desktop</li> <li>Renamed the Firefox desktop icon to &quot;Internet&quot;</li> <li>Setup her Wifi (which I had to do for her on Windows too)</li> </ul> <p>After giving it to her, she had 4 questions:</p> <ul> <li>&quot;Why does it look different?&quot; </li> </ul> <p>I told her that I &quot;set it up a little differently in a way I thought would be better for her; if she struggled with it, I could set it back to how it was&quot;. She was surprisingly open to this idea compared to what I expected. </p> <ul> <li>&quot;How do I get to the internet?&quot;</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m assuming she was looking at the icons to find the internet, not the text I&#39;d placed under them; since Firefox looks different than Chrome, this was a reasonable hurdle in migration that I hadn&#39;t considered. I showed her the new icon and the label to remind her. </p> <ul> <li>&quot;I&#39;m clicking but nothing is happening&quot;</li> </ul> <p>She was single clicking on icons instead of double clicking; this is how her Windows laptop was setup too, so I&#39;m not sure why this hurdle happened. Maybe she was assuming it would be more like her phone now with single tap app loading?</p> <ul> <li>&quot;Do I have to turn it off every night, or can I just close the lid? I don&#39;t want to get hacked.&quot;</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m not sure where this question came from at all. She lives alone, so she wasn&#39;t talking about someone stumbling across it while it was unlocked. I told her she could do either. </p> <p>While I was there, she checked her gmail without issue, played solitaire for a bit, and then found the shutdown menu on her own without needing any assistance. </p> <p>Since then, she hasn&#39;t called me a single time about computer issues; she used to regularly call and ask if it was ok that her computer was updating, and any time an update would cause a noticeable change she would be worried that &quot;a virus did something&quot;. But things are just more seamless now. </p> <p>TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE:</p> <ul> <li><p>Visuals are important for intuitive migration from one OS to another, even more so than text. I personally think Cinnamon is the DE that offers the most intuitive transition from Windows. </p></li> <li><p>&quot;Automatic updates&quot; are a contentious issue; I think people care more about the <em>way</em> Windows does automatic updates rather than the fact that they exist at all (adding/changing features, and reboots in particular). </p></li> </ul> <p>Overall, it seems to have been a positive experience for both of us.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/manofsticks"> /u/manofsticks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whbte0/my_experience_giving_my_mom_a_linux_laptop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whbte0/my_experience_giving_my_mom_a_linux_laptop/">[comments]</a></span>
