<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So <code>visual</code>-type line numbers are pretty much the only option I have currently if I want the numbering to respect folding of any kind (in code and org), but the issue that I currently face with <code>visual</code> line numbers is that they completely poop out with text wrapping (which makes sense considering that they are <code>visual</code>), is there any way to make it work?</p> <p>As an alternative, <code>relative</code>-style numbering respects text wrapping but fails with folds, so kinda makes this a weird place to be in XD. I&#39;ve attached an example of a wrapped line where this fail can be seen in all it&#39;s glory.</p> <p>I would really appreciate any help with this, thanks!</p> <p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/lwK3rWl.png">https://i.imgur.com/lwK3rWl.png</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/purely_educational"> /u/purely_educational </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/waziv7/visual_line_numbers_not_playing_well_with_text/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/waziv7/visual_line_numbers_not_playing_well_with_text/">[comments]</a></span>
