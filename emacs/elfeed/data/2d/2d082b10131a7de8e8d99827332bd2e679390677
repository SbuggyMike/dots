  A preliminary report finds that catching Covid-19 twice (easy to do,
  with the BA.5 variant) <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/health/covid-reinfection-risk/index.html">more than doubles the subsequent danger</a>, compared
  with catching it only once.
<p>
  The study measured how many people died, were hospitalized, or developed
  various long-term medical problems in the subsequent six months.

  Each reinfection adds to the total risk, and the amount it adds
  increases too.
<p>
  Perhaps this means we need the new vaccines developed for Omicron.  Or
  perhaps we need a different one for BA.5.  Meanwhile, making a
  practice of wearing a mask when you are indoors with other people,
  except for your few closest friends, is something you can do now to
  protect yourself and others.
