<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR-below. </p> <p>If both Armenia and Uzbekistan wins, we move to the second tiebreaker: Olympiad-Sonneborn-Berger-Tie-Break without lowest result (Chennai) .<br/> This is calculated as follows:<br/> Number of Match Points of the opposing team * Your score in Board Points.<br/> Armenia is currently 54.5 points behind in this tiebreaker. This seems like a tremendous amount (and it is). </p> <p>We start with the bad news, Uzbekistan won with 3-1 against Armenia. As both teams win again, Armenia will get 2 x 1 = 2 additional SB points for their result against Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan will get 2 x 3 = 6 additional SB points from their result against Armenia. </p> <p>So the gap is actually 58.5 . </p> <p>If Armenia wins this match against Spain with 4-0 and Uzbekistan with 2.5 - 1.5 against Holland, Armenia will get 15 x 4 = 60 points from this match. Uzbekistan will only retrieve 15 x 2.5 points = 37.5 points from this match. </p> <p>So, the current gap is: 58.5 - 60 + 37.5 = 36 points remaining. </p> <p>Then we have an important additional rule. The worst result does not count for this math. Currently the worst score of Armenia is Madagascar, 10 points (4-0 victory). But the second worst score is Andorra (11 points), but only a 3-1 victory. If Madagascar wins the match, and Andorra draws or loses), Andorra will be the worst tiebreaker.Any other result will indeed swap the worst tiebreaker, but insufficient.</p> <p>Madagascar wins, Andorra does not win, and both Faroe and Nepal loses.<br/> Old situation Armenia:<br/> Andorra: 3 x 11 = 33<br/> Madagascar: 4 x 10 = 40 (discarded, as this is the worst result according to the regulations)</p> <p>New situation Armenia:<br/> Andorra: 3 x 11 = 33 (discarded)<br/> Madagascar: 4 x 12 = 48</p> <p>So the gap closes with 15 points to 21 points. </p> <p>Then we have a number of mutual opponents:<br/> India 2: A victory for India 2 is necessary. Armenia won with 2.5, Uzbekistan drew with 2. Not only does Armenia get 1 additional point, India 2 plays Germany. Uzbekistan has played against Germany, and we don&#39;t want Uzbekistan to score more Olympiad-SB.<br/> India: A victory for India is the ideal result. Armenia won with 2.5, Uzbekistan drew with 2. 1 additional points for Armenia.<br/> USA: Both tied 2-2 against USA. </p> <p>So, the gap is now 19 points.</p> <p>Other opponents Armenia:<br/> England (x2.5), Azerbaijan (x3) , Egypt (x2.5) and Austria (x3). If all 4 teams win their matches, Armenia will get 22 additional Olympiad-SB points. </p> <p>So, we imagine that all other opponents of Uzbekistan: Faroe (x4), Nepal (x4), Slovenia (x3), Slovakia(x4), Peru (x4), Germany (x2.5) will lose their match.</p> <p>If all this happens, Armenia will lead by 3 Olympiad-SB at that moment. As Armenia can&#39;t impossible win on the third tiebreaker (Board Points), Armenia need at least 0.5 Olympiad SB more than Uzbekistan. So, we have 2.5 Olympiad-SB room for &#39;mistakes&#39; (non-ideal results). As Uzbekistan always scored 3 or more board points, we can&#39;t let one of their opponents draw a match. </p> <p>So, the following deviations are allowed:<br/> India can draw or lose vs team USA<br/> OR<br/> England draws gamegame<br/> OR<br/> Egypt</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>draws their game</p> <p>TLDR:<br/> Of course it is yes, otherwise there was no question in the title.<br/> The following things must happen:</p> <p>Armenia wins with 4-0, Uzbekistan wins with 2.5 -1.5 .<br/> And the following countries win: Madagascar, England (* see below), Azerbijan, Egypt (* see below), Austria, India 2.<br/> The following teams lose their match: Germany (vs India 2), Faroe, Nepal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Peru<br/> The following teams will not win their match: Andorra </p> <p>(*) England OR Egypt can draw their match , but then must India win against team USA.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jakeloans"> /u/jakeloans </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wjgtxe/can_armenia_still_win_the_championship_when/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wjgtxe/can_armenia_still_win_the_championship_when/">[comments]</a></span>
