<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been getting this error for months now. I downloaded the arch iso from the official <a href="https://archlinux.org">archlinux.org</a> links using the magnetic link, and verified the signature, with output:</p> <pre><code>gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-2022.07.01-x86_64.iso.sig Wed Jul 20 17:38:09 2022 gpg: assuming signed data in &#39;archlinux-2022.07.01-x86_64.iso&#39; gpg: Signature made Fri Jul 1 10:23:08 2022 -03 gpg: using RSA key 4AA4767BBC9C4B1D18AE28B77F2D434B9741E8AC gpg: issuer &quot;pierre@archlinux.de&quot; gpg: Good signature from &quot;Pierre Schmitz &lt;pierre@archlinux.de&gt;&quot; [unknown] gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature! gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner. Primary key fingerprint: 4AA4 767B BC9C 4B1D 18AE 28B7 7F2D 434B 9741 E8AC </code></pre> <p>And then followed the installation steps, but when I reach the &quot;pacstrap -i /mnt base&quot; step, it returns a bunch of signature errors:</p> <pre><code>:: File /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg/base-2-2-any.pkg.tar.xz is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)). Do you want to delete it? [Y/n] error: failed to commit transaction (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)) Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded. ==&gt; ERROR: Failed to install packages to new root </code></pre> <p>This happens with about 30 or more signatures, and what I don&#39;t understand, is that I used the same iso image to install Arch on two different computers multiple times and it worked, in fact, I&#39;m using one of them right now! Also, this error is happening not only on my host machine, but when I tried to create a VM on my gf&#39;s laptop, the same issues occurred.</p> <p>I&#39;m honestly clueless on what to do next, could it be a silly configuration that I missed?</p> <p>I also tried &quot;pacman -S archlinux-keyring&quot; and populating the keys, but the errors persist</p> <p>Anyway, heres my host machine and software info:</p> <pre><code>OS: Arch Linux x86_64 Host: Aspire E1-531 V2.15 Kernel: 5.15.55-1-lts CPU: Intel Celeron 1000M (2) @ 1.800GHz GPU: Intel 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller Memory: 2927MiB / 3740MiB </code></pre> <p>Virutalbox info:</p> <pre><code>VirtualBox Graphical User Interface Version 6.1.34 r150636 </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VinoLemos"> /u/VinoLemos </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3x9gp/virtual_machine_failed_to_install_packages_to_new/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3x9gp/virtual_machine_failed_to_install_packages_to_new/">[comments]</a></span>
