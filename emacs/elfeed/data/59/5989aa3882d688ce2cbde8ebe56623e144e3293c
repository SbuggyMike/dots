<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the past, I&#39;ve heard a lot of people say ZorinOS interface is not original and that they just fork stuff and hacked Ubuntu to be ZorinOS but that&#39;s not the case.</p> <p>Zorin Menu and Zorin Taskbar were 100% original extensions developed by Artyom for the ZorinOS and Dash to Panel and Arc Menu are forks of these 2 extensions developed by Zorin. Later Arc Menu and Dash to Panel got a lot more popular and a cyclic contribution started between Arc Menu and Zorin Menu.</p> <p>To learn that Gnome wouldn&#39;t have had a taskbar or start menu if not for ZorinOS is kinda mind blowing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NayamAmarshe"> /u/NayamAmarshe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vx67jm/til_gnomes_most_famous_extensions_dash_to_panel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vx67jm/til_gnomes_most_famous_extensions_dash_to_panel/">[comments]</a></span>
