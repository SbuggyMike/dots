<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title says, what have they actually achieved that is beneficial for the country in their 12 years? </p> <p>I know that if you look at Labour’s 13 years from 1997-2010 there are a number of significant milestones like;</p> <ul> <li>introducing the minimum wage</li> <li>introduced the right to 24 days paid holiday for full time workers -increased police by 14,000 which lead to a 32% reduction in crime</li> <li>85,000 more nurses</li> <li>32,000 more doctors</li> <li>36,000 more teachers</li> <li>introduced 2 weeks paternity leave</li> <li>saw record numeracy and literacy in schools</li> <li>record number of student in higher education</li> </ul> <p>And there are a whole bunch of others that are easy to look up.</p> <p>Now, I’m no fan of Blair and Brown in particular, but what they achieved (in general) was to the benefit of the country. Iraq &amp; Afghanistan were stupid, pointless wars, and I say that as an ex-serviceman. And the global financial crisis killed the economy in 2008, but even then, it was because of the US banks, we just didn’t have a tight enough grip on our own bankers which was, of course, stupid.</p> <p>So they did a lot of good, and alot of bad. </p> <p>But the Tories have been in power now for 1 year less than Labour were. They’ve had a similar global catastrophy in Covid in the last 2 years so I’d say that it makes it a fair comparison between the two.</p> <p>So, once again, I ask you... what good have the Tories actually done in 12 years?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/njt1986"> /u/njt1986 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/wc2u3c/what_have_the_tories_actually_achieved_in_12_years/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/wc2u3c/what_have_the_tories_actually_achieved_in_12_years/">[comments]</a></span>
