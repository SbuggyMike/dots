<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. I&#39;m not gonna ask what cloud provider do you use (But you can tell it if you want): many will use self-hosted Nextcloud, some others will use Google Drive, others will use pCloud, MEGA, etc... </p> <p>What I&#39;m gonna ask you instead is how do you interact with your cloud storage. </p> <ul> <li>Do you mainly access it by mounting it and reading/writing as an external file system, or do you use some kind of shared folder that is periodically refreshed to match the remote/local content?<br/> <ul> <li>If there is a periodically refreshed shared folder, how often is it refreshed? How is it achieved?<br/></li> </ul></li> <li>How do you deal with conflicts? Are you happy with your setup in this regard?</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cidra_"> /u/cidra_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w7kkvj/how_do_you_manage_your_cloud_storage/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w7kkvj/how_do_you_manage_your_cloud_storage/">[comments]</a></span>
