<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I feel like most of the reviews on the Internet are useless, because all the author does is fire up a live session, try to install it in a VM (or maybe a multiboot), and discuss the default programs – which can be changed in 5 minutes. There’s a lack of long term reviews, hardware compatibility reviews, and so on. The lack of long-term testing in particular is annoying; the warts usually come out then.</p> <p>Does anyone else agree?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alex_Strgzr"> /u/Alex_Strgzr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vvsc20/distro_reviews_could_be_more_useful/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vvsc20/distro_reviews_could_be_more_useful/">[comments]</a></span>
