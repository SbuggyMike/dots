<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love Linux a lot, it was almost life changing when I moved from Windows to Linux about a year ago. However recently (a few months ago) I picked up a new laptop with an 1440p 14 inch display, and was introduced to the dumpster fire that is scaling on Linux. I genuinely do not understand why getting good looking scaling on all of the apps I use is so difficult. Granted I&#39;m no developer, so I could be completely missing something, but is it really that hard to just make everything bigger? Especially with QT apps, it looks horrible. The text is large, but all of the UI elements are absolutely tiny, so it ends up looking uneven and just bad. Sometimes it renders the apps completely unusable, like with Kwrite. Mac OS and Windows handle it almost perfectly, with just a single slider that doesn&#39;t drop your display resolution or font clarity, and just makes everything bigger. With Linux, you have to edit a billion different configs for different GUI frameworks, or edit each individual app config, or you just cant do anything and your stuck with tiny unusable font and tiny unusable UI elements. Again, I&#39;m no developer, so there might be something that I don&#39;t understand. However I also don&#39;t see why all of the major GUI frameworks can&#39;t listen to one global variable that&#39;s set by the DE or WM, and just go off that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ButWhatIfItQueffed"> /u/ButWhatIfItQueffed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wgyugy/why_is_scaling_still_such_an_absolute_train_wreck/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wgyugy/why_is_scaling_still_such_an_absolute_train_wreck/">[comments]</a></span>
