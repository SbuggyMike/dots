<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like a billion other people, I love playing cricket and I love every second of it. I had both time and friends in the lockdown last year to play cricket and I did so every morning for more than 4 or 5 months. But ever since workplaces and colleges got opened back again, everyone went their own separate ways and haven&#39;t been able to play since then. Now I have no time to play but will probably get time to do it again when I most likely move to Bangalore in a few months. Are there any clubs(not for training) or group of cricket enthusiasts in Bangalore whom I can join to play on weekends? Like with other working professionals or literally anyone (not kids though lol)? How do you guys satisfy your thirst to yeet that ball over the boundary or rattle the stumps? And I am not sure but I am guessing finding a place for the game is gonna be a challenge in a city like Bangalore. It will be more than a year till I move to Bangalore but a man can day dream.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Whattheheckyo78"> /u/Whattheheckyo78 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wgmtc3/i22m_am_experiencing_a_drought_of_cricket_and_its/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wgmtc3/i22m_am_experiencing_a_drought_of_cricket_and_its/">[comments]</a></span>
