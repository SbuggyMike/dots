<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today I wanted to reinstall Arch. My previous system was on a LUKS2 encrypted Partition. I tried installing with &#39;archinstall&#39; which I installed with pacman on the live system. But it gave me an error. Something with encryption password. I jumped to conclusions and tried removing the encryption following the archwiki guide. That gave me halfway through an error: &quot;Volume group &quot;myvg&quot; not found&quot;</p> <p>I looked for solutions and other methods and somewhere read even though the partition is encrypted I should still be able to format the drive fine. Because I didn&#39;t care for the data on the drive I did just that with parted. &#39;lsblk&#39; recognized the new partition just fine. But I am still unable to install arch with the error &#39;AttributeError: NoneType object has no attribute encryption_password&#39;</p> <p>This has taken up the better half of my day and I am at a loss for things to try and google isn&#39;t spitting out much either. Help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Luky_Luk"> /u/Luky_Luk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1312h51/noob_cant_install_arch_after_formatting_luks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1312h51/noob_cant_install_arch_after_formatting_luks/">[comments]</a></span>
