It is the stage of the game when most of the pieces have been captured, and the focus shifts to the king and the pawns. At this point, a player&#39;s ability to think ahead and plan their moves can make the difference between a win and a loss.</p> <p>Endgame strategy requires a deep understanding of the relative values of the pieces and how they interact with each other. For example, a king and a pawn can work together to capture an opposing piece, but the king must be protected from potential threats.
