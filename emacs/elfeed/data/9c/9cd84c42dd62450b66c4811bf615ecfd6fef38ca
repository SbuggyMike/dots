<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently gotten into listening to symphonies (previously stuck to listening to solo instrument pieces and concerti). I have a soft spot for winds, especially the flute and oboe. Amongst my favourite symphonies so far are Dvorak 5, 8 and Beethoven 3, 6 and 9. I&#39;m not too experienced with classical music in general as I&#39;ve only been listening for about a year so I may not be able to appreciate very mature works. All suggestions are welcome, thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AbsoluteDINKage"> /u/AbsoluteDINKage </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wj21q0/recommend_me_symphonic_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wj21q0/recommend_me_symphonic_music/">[comments]</a></span>
