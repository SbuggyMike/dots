<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Now before I say this, I do think for simple scripts, Bash is fine. But when those scripts start including more complicated logic, things get... verbose</p> <p>Last night I converted some shell scripts to Lua (with the sh module from luarocks) and holy smokes, why isn&#39;t Lua used more often? </p> <p>The syntax is sensible, there&#39;s no &quot;double quotes <em>something something</em> variable expansion&quot; warning from shellcheck to deal with, the sh module makes it look like a proper shell script. Heck, this was my first time with Lua, I only had LuaJIT installed as a Neovim dependency.</p> <p>So my question is, why isn&#39;t Lua adopted more as a shell scripting language, and hat other languages have y&#39;all used as Bash alternatives?</p> <p>EDIT: wow, did not expect this. Guess people really like talking about shell scripting o-o</p> <p>Anyway I&#39;ve had some people ask why Lua? Well tbh, Lua was the first thing that came to mind (I guess because of Neovim) and I already had it installed anyway. Plus, it&#39;s an extra language to add to my list of languages &quot;learned&quot;</p> <p>Some have also pointed out that the sh module just moves the problem. I agree, but Lua makes the logic of a program as a whole much, much more readable, so I consider it a fair tradeoff. The double quotes thing also wasn&#39;t my only issue with Bash, just an example I mentioned.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StandingadAnimations"> /u/StandingadAnimations </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12yokxl/lua_as_a_bash_alternative/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12yokxl/lua_as_a_bash_alternative/">[comments]</a></span>
