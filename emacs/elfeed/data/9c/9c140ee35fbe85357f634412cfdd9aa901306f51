<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To be clear, I am referring to the screen that appears after sleep or hibernate or press <code>Ctrl+Alt+L</code>. Not SDDM display manager.</p> <p>In the lock screen, I sometimes need to type in my password once, get rejected, type again, rejected, and finally press an <code>Unlock</code> button that appears instead of a password field. This doesn&#39;t happen every time, but it happens often.</p> <p>Perhaps something related is that I use <code>systemd-home</code>. I tried looking at the <code>pam.d</code> files for <code>kde</code> and <code>sddm</code> and I couldn&#39;t see anything odd.</p> <p>I thought I&#39;d post here, since I don&#39;t know what exactly is causing this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-o0__0o-"> /u/-o0__0o- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0gjlg/cant_log_in_from_kde_lock_screen_sometimes/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0gjlg/cant_log_in_from_kde_lock_screen_sometimes/">[comments]</a></span>
