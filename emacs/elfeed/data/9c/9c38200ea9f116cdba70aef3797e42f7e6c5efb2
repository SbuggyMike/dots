<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I remember a couple of years back I had plugged my laptop into a faulty outlet and fried the charger. I had to get a new one but I was broke so I just picked up the cheapest one that could fit into my laptop. I didn’t think of the wattage of it at the time so I severely underpowered my laptop causing it to run so slow that windows wasn’t even a possibility for me. I looked around online for a couple hours and I stumbled across an operating system that promised to breathe new life into my laptop. I booted into Linux mint and it worked like a dream. I’ve never looked back since and I’m glad I did. How did you start using Linux?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Feisty-Republic-2098"> /u/Feisty-Republic-2098 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w1vgdy/how_did_you_start_using_find_out_about_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w1vgdy/how_did_you_start_using_find_out_about_linux/">[comments]</a></span>
