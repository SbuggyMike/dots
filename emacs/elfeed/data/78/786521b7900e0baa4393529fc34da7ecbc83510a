<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>10+5 game</p> <p>I have 20 seconds on the clock, one passed pawn, one rook, and I’ve blocked their only other pawn. </p> <p>If I was relaxed, I would be able to ladder mate them easily, but with twitchy fingers and time concerns (I was playing with less than a minute to their 7 for most of the game), I could see myself spending too much time thinking. They ultimately resigned soon after we traded queens, but my plan would have been to parade my king around for a bit buy myself an extra 30 seconds. </p> <p>If flagging is moving to make your opponent lose on time, what’s the term for moving to get back some time for yourself? Is there even a word for it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nopornthrowaways"> /u/nopornthrowaways </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wfr3gt/is_there_a_term_for_premoving_solely_for_the_sake/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wfr3gt/is_there_a_term_for_premoving_solely_for_the_sake/">[comments]</a></span>
