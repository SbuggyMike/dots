<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Personally mine are Sibelius Violin Concerto and Mozart&#39;s Clarinet Concerto. I love Sibelius for the feelings that I get while listening to the concerto, the first movement Is beautiful, It Is almost a serenade, so emotional. The second is, I think, melodically gorgeus, very calm. The third Is a mix of different emotions, absolutely love the flute solos in there, the violin seems so powerful in this movement.</p> <p>Mozart&#39;s Clarinet Concerto Is, I think, the most beautiful concerto to listen to, everything about It Is just perfect, elegant (1st movement), romantic (2nd movement), brilliant and energetic (3rd movement).</p> <p>Feel free to share your opinions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/us_nauman"> /u/us_nauman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/12zzhby/what_are_your_favorite_concertos_of_all_time/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/12zzhby/what_are_your_favorite_concertos_of_all_time/">[comments]</a></span>
