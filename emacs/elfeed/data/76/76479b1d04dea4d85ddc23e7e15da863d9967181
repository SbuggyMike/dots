It’s been several times now that I described my productivity system here. While I like it a lot, it still has room for improvement. Some time ago I mentioned it to a colleague and shared one frustration I have with it. When I fail to do even one thing on my carefully prepared plan for a day (which happens once in a while, of course), sometimes I lose motivation and skip more subsequent items. This leads to spending less time on things I want to do and more time on procrastination that day. It happens seldom enough not to be a real issue (and it doesn’t mean I fail to do anything – just less than usual or hoped for), but it is a bit frustrating. He suggested a pretty clever (and obvious in hindsight) way to deal with this. His idea is to have a separate music playlist „for work” and train my brain to associate that particular music with focused work. That way I would have another nudge to do particular kind of stuff.
