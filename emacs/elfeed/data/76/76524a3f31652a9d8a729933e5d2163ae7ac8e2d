<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Likely VK_KHR_Surface. Vulkan fails me for an app. Dxvk makes it crash prompting a vulkan error and no dxvk makes it have if&#39;s speed halved. My Nvidia GPU (1660) supports vulkan and I have nvidia-utils installed.</p> <p>A dude told me he has a similar model but he uses KHR Surface.
