<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good morning, Happy Tuesday (forgot yesterday was Monday until it was too late) and welcome to another selection for our sub&#39;s weekly listening club. Each week, we&#39;ll listen to a piece recommended by the community, discuss it, learn about it, and hopefully introduce us to music we wouldn&#39;t hear otherwise :)</p> <p>Last week, we listened to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/12qgvwj/potw59_kabalevsky_the_comedians_suite/">Kabalevsky’s The Comedians Suite</a>. You can go back to listen, read up, and discuss the work if you want to. </p> <p>Our next Piece of the Week is <strong>Richard Strauss’ Oboe Concerto (1945)</strong></p> <p>…</p> <p><strong>Score from IMSLP</strong></p> <p><a href="https://imslp.eu/files/imglnks/euimg/2/25/IMSLP01700-R.Strauss_-_Konzert_fur_Oboe_und_Orchester_(Orchestral_Score).pdf">https://imslp.eu/files/imglnks/euimg/2/25/IMSLP01700-R.Strauss_-_Konzert_fur_Oboe_und_Orchester_(Orchestral_Score).pdf</a></p> <p>...</p> <p>some listening notes from <a href="https://qcso.org/wp-content/uploads/Program-Notes-MWV-2018-19.pdf">Jacob Bancks</a></p> <blockquote> <p>The mobilization of the American people during World War II was nearly universal, and this included musicians. Among those recruited into the Allied effort was John de Lancie, then principal oboist of the Pittsburgh Symphony under Fritz Reiner. He joined the United States Army Band and later served as an intelligence operative in occupied Germany. After the war, he would become one of America’s most prominent oboists, performing in the Philadelphia Orchestra and running the famed Curtis Institute of Music. (His son, incidentally, would become an actor, portraying the character “Q” on Star Trek: The Next Generation.) </p> <p>Shortly after the war had ended, while he was still stationed in Germany, de Lancie heard that the elderly composer Richard Strauss was living in the Bavarian resort town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Curious, the oboist-soldier decided to pay the composer a visit, and Strauss, eager to maintain good relations with occupying American forces, received his fellow musician kindly. Over the course of their conversation, de Lancie asked a burning question: had the old master ever thought about writing an oboe concerto? Strauss answered with a simple, “No.”</p> <p>To be sure, it was kind of an odd question: oboe concertos are rare, and the 81-yearold Strauss, most famous for his grandiloquent tone poems and operas, had written only three concertos in total (two of them for horn, his father’s instrument). But in any case, de Lancie’s ended up being a very consequential question: shortly thereafter Strauss completed his Concerto for Oboe and Small Orchestra, explaining publicly that he had written it at an American soldier’s suggestion. De Lancie learned of the piece’s existence in the newspaper. </p> <p>The resulting piece provides an illuminating glimpse into the end of an intriguing and influential musical career. Strauss was first credited with initiating the musical shockwaves of the early twentieth century: this was the composer who burst into the international music scene with the overwhelming flourish of Don Juan in 1888 and scandalized the world with his salacious, harmonically adventurous opera Salome in 1905. But he also began to show a less revolutionary, more nostalgic side as early as 1911 with his comic opera Der Rosenkavalier, set in mideighteenth-century Vienna (one might almost imagine the opera being performed in the Redoutensaal!). By the 1940s, he had composed himself firmly back into the nineteenth century, with works like Metamorphosen for string orchestra, the Four Last Songs, and his oboe concerto. This regression was a disappointment to those who had deigned him the standard-bearer of atonality, but a welcome development for midtwentieth-century audiences still eager for the trappings of romanticism.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ways to Listen</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>François Leleux with Daniel Harding and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUCtstlCDj8">YouTube</a> [score video], <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/14gVF3IYbIK2n3AkhC2Kyk?si=FONh1wGATXik45JvCPppmQ">Spotify</a></p></li> <li><p>François Leleux with Nicholas Collon and the Aurora Orchestra: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo7HAAtmP_4">YouTube</a> [2016 Proms]</p></li> <li><p>Lucas Macías Navarro with Leopold Hager and La Orquesta Sinfónica de RTVE: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1zTN453vNo">YouTube</a></p></li> <li><p>Martin Tinev with Sebastian Tweinkel and the Orchestra of the Trossingen Musikhochschule: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AprDqEvUtmI">YouTube</a></p></li> <li><p>Alexei Ogrintchouk with Andris Nelsons and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0MjzoeiOLBy9dtUKoKcz6o?si=TaVtyCl_TSShAfpTOBRCLg">Spotify</a></p></li> <li><p>John de Lancie with André Previn and the London Symphony Orchestra: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2F4FXt7113XwnOXAdTMYMg?si=sWLR-UGeSN-ygZvDlJcRKA">Spotify</a></p></li> <li><p>Cristina Gómez Godoy with Daniel Barenboim and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1g2c1AB9QGIGtF3HDeC6zM?si=WdpWkMCKS7uDCm9MiE9b6A">Spotify</a></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Discussion Prompts</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>What are your favorite parts or moments in this work?
