<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>curious on the specific workflows to fork a project on github all the way to contributing a pull request. The manual describes a lot of options, some steps can take place on github vs others on emacs - how do you guys normally go about it?</p> <ol> <li>forking the repo - this you do on github then save the links to the original project and your fork? </li> <li>clone your fork (or original?) regular magit can do the clone, or commandline, or forge?</li> <li>add the original project remote calling it upstream if you cloned your own copy (or perhaps adding your fork as another remote if you cloned the original?)</li> <li>hereafter everything can be done in forge or do any of you still switch to browser for some things?</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hooxen"> /u/Hooxen </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf6zgj/how_do_you_guys_use_forge_with_magit_and_github/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf6zgj/how_do_you_guys_use_forge_with_magit_and_github/">[comments]</a></span>
