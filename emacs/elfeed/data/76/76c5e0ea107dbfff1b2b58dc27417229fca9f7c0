<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to preface by saying that I have read the wiki on fdisk and the installation guide</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to install Arch on my new x13 laptop which came with windows pre-installed. My goal is to dual boot with windows. When I run fdisk during as a part of the installation process I&#39;m really confused by the output</p> <p>The laptop has a 256G SSD and when I look at the entries in fdisk some of them say ~900G. What does that mean? Also, when I try to create a partition it often says that I&#39;ve reached the maximum number. I successfully installed Arch on a macbook air years ago and I remember it being more straightforward</p> <p>Thanks so much</p> <p>Edit see screenshot: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WGB29wB">https://imgur.com/a/WGB29wB</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd-Distribution2887"> /u/Odd-Distribution2887 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138wv25/fdisk_confusion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138wv25/fdisk_confusion/">[comments]</a></span>
