<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I possess arch installed on a Dell Xps 13 and everything has been working fine up till now. Yesterday I noticed that my touchpad clicks didn’t work when I physically pressed down on the touchpad, but I can still move around my mouse and I can also like tap the touchpad and it clicks. I can also do everything else with my touchpad like scroll with 2 fingers‍ etc. but physically clicking down on it does not work? How do I fix this it’s been bothering me</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xserenarow"> /u/xserenarow </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whw8s8/clicking_randomly_stops_working_but_tapping_still/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whw8s8/clicking_randomly_stops_working_but_tapping_still/">[comments]</a></span>
