<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is a question many seem to ponder. What is the short and long answer? Can the hardware such as CPU collect the same level on private information such as contacts, passwords, sites visited etc as for example Windows can? </p> <p>Is it true that it really does not make any difference (as some claim) that whether you use Windows or for example Fedora Linux if the hardware is not open as RISC-V is?
