<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My mother was a cellist in her younger years, having played in her city’s symphony and college quartet. I’m looking for recommendations for cello-centric music to play during her photo slideshow at the services, and also possibly a brief cello solo piece that could be played during the service that would be appropriate.</p> <p>I don’t have a lot of time to audition on my own without some guidance, so I’m hoping I could get some recommendations. Any help is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MAN1FSTDESTINY"> /u/MAN1FSTDESTINY </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/130qsta/music_recommendation_needed_for_mothers_funeral/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/130qsta/music_recommendation_needed_for_mothers_funeral/">[comments]</a></span>
