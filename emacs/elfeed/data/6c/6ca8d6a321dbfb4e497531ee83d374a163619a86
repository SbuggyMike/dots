Texas is planning to pass
<a href="https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2023/04/11/texas-death-star-bill-on-track-to-decimate-local-worker-and-consumer-protections/">a bill to invalidate local regulations</a>
in a
sweeping way.  This would include regulations to *protect workers,
consumers, and the environment.*
<p>
Naturally, ALEC is involved, showing that the main benefit will be for
the rich.

I expect that fascists will use this to prevent cities and counties
from resisting voter-suppression.
