<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I use completing-read and show the selection in a new frame I get the prompt but the options are not shown. I have to type a character and then delete it in order to force a refresh and make the options show up.</p> <p>Why is this happening?</p> <p>Is there any way show the options right away?</p> <p>OS: Arch Linux</p> <p>Emacs version: 28.1</p> <p>I have the same issue in emacs -Q, although the completion works differently in vanilla Emacs. I am using the consult/vertico/orderless framework.</p> <p>Here is the test code that you can run in your emacs config or in emacs -Q. In my case the result is the same. The new frame does not show options right away. I have to insert a character or press tab to see them.</p> <pre><code>(defun test-miniframe-completing-read () &quot;Test miniframe completing read&quot; (interactive) (with-selected-frame (make-frame &#39;((name . &quot;emacs-miniframe&quot;) (minibuffer . only) (width . 120) (height . 33))) (unwind-protect (let ((choices &#39;(&quot;first&quot; &quot;second&quot; &quot;third&quot;))) (completing-read &quot;Select: &quot; choices)) (delete-frame)))) (test-miniframe-completing-read) </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kamui78"> /u/kamui78 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/133ddro/completingread_shows_the_prompt_but_not_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/133ddro/completingread_shows_the_prompt_but_not_the/">[comments]</a></span>
