<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w13wkp/retro_emacs_281_via_coolretroterm/">stunning example of retro abuse</a>. I get that it’s fun—for some people—to revisit old tech but if this looks good to you, seek help. I’m old enough to have worked with those terminals—both the green and amber versions—and I can tell you, unequivocally, that there’s no way I’d choose to go back.</p>
<p>Emulations like this are fine for pranking that annoying guy at the office but I can’t imagine anyone choosing to use it. But that’s me. Judging from the comments, there are a lot of folks who disagree. Whatever floats your boat as they say but I’m happy running Emacs in GUI mode and failing that in a decent, modern terminal.</p>
<p>Of course, all this from a guy who yearns for his very own Lisp Machine.</p>
