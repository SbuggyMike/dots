<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It is said that one cannot simply encrypt their home directory/partition because the system will often store sensitive data elsewhere in the system which would not be encrypted. This makes me wonder if one could simply also encrypt these other sensitive directories. Which directories would these be? I would assume <code>/var</code>, and <code>/tmp</code>. All that would then have to happen is the user would mount and unlock those directories at login. Or would this cause issues for the system? Do these directories need to be available at boot?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Izerpizer"> /u/Izerpizer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13jq58a/what_root_directories_should_be_encrypted_on_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13jq58a/what_root_directories_should_be_encrypted_on_a/">[comments]</a></span>
