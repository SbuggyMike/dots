Governor <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#dementis">DeMentis</a> is hell-bent on punishing Disney.  His latest plan
is to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/17/ron-desantis-prison-near-disney-theme-park">build a prison next to Disney World</a>.
<p>
I expect it will take years to start construction.  By then, <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#dementis">DeMentis</a>
probably won't be governor any more; his successor will not have the
same grudge against Disney, so <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#perse">perse</a> will make a deal with Disney.
<p>
<a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#dementis">DeMentis's</a> mania for punising anyone that won't bend the knee to him
is alarming.
<p>
However, Disney's being in a dispute with <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#dementis">DeMentis</a>, who is clearly our
enemy, does not make Disney deserve our admiration.  Disney is not our
friend.  Disney is one of the companies responsible for the Digital
Millenium Coyright Act.
