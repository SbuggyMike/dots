<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been using org-ref to embed citations in files and I can open them up in a pdf by pressing the <code>C-c C-o p</code> command. But I think it would be more useful to automatically open it in org noter so that I can see the pdf on one side and my notes on the other side which is more readable and easier to understand than just displaying a pdf. I was curious to know how others have achieved this because often times I have citations in my notes and I want to refresh my memory so I would like to see the notes I took for that citation rather than just the pdf?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/waterstrider123"> /u/waterstrider123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wha26h/how_to_open_orgref_citation_in_orgnoter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wha26h/how_to_open_orgref_citation_in_orgnoter/">[comments]</a></span>
