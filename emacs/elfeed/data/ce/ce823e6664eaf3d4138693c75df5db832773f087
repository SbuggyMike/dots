<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Honestly, I&#39;m considering quitting all online rated chess. I&#39;ve come up against so many blatant, some not so blatant cheaters in the past month and it leaves such a sour taste in my mouth. </p> <p>I&#39;m rated around 1700-1800 on <a href="https://Chess.com">Chess.com</a> Rapid currently and I&#39;m playing people with consistent 95+ accuracies in sharp, tactical positions who play every move with a 5-7 increment. </p> <p>I genuinely believe the problem is FAR more widespread than the statistics are showing. It feels as though every third person or so is questionable. </p> <p>Has anyone else been experiencing this? If so, does it demoralise you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jonalmarspectac"> /u/Jonalmarspectac </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/131vl9s/cheating_on_chesscom/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/131vl9s/cheating_on_chesscom/">[comments]</a></span>
