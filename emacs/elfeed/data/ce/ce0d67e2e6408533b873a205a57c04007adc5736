<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had ZERO screen tearing since 4 days ago i Arch with Xorg and LXQt, and created <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf</code>:</p> <pre><code>Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier &quot;Intel Graphics&quot; Driver &quot;intel&quot; Option &quot;TearFree&quot; &quot;true&quot; EndSection </code></pre> <p>But today, I was using Brave browser, then I started watching a YouTube video. It bugged out for a second, then immediate screen tearing.</p> <p>There were also weird pixel lines of different colors over the bottom half of the video when I hovered my cursor over it, but they went away when my cursor did. Most likely something to do with Brave alone.</p> <p>But now my entire system has screen tearing again.</p> <p>What could it be? I don&#39;t use a compositor at all, could that possibly be a factor?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/loganr914"> /u/loganr914 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4vlfo/screen_tearing_returned_suddenly_even_though_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4vlfo/screen_tearing_returned_suddenly_even_though_i/">[comments]</a></span>
