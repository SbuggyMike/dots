<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So basically I dual boot windows and arch but one day I logged into windows after like a month of not opening it to use a school software and it f**king decides to do some update and completely delete my bootable arch system, it didn&#39;t delete the partition though so my data was still safe. I decided to install another os by just making a 60gb partition and now I can boot into my previous original arch install through the grub of the new one and everything works. </p> <p>Question is I can&#39;t figure out how to get the old grub entry back into my efi so I can delete this new one and not have an unnecessary install just to boot into my other install. I tried doing grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg but that didn&#39;t work. Help would be appreciated as I can&#39;t find clear answer on the net either for this specific problem</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Previous_Royal2168"> /u/Previous_Royal2168 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6z8c4/restore_my_grub_efi_entry_for_my_linux_install/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6z8c4/restore_my_grub_efi_entry_for_my_linux_install/">[comments]</a></span>
