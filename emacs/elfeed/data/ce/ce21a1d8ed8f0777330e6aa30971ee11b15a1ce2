Some of the prison <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> in US federal prisons make a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/06/federal-prison-sexual-abuse-deportation-california-mexico">practice of
    pressuring prisoners for sex</a>, especially prisoners who are not US
citizens and might be deported.  Those who testify about this are
often punished with deportation.
<p>
Officials have invented bureaucratic excuses to block the factual
investigation of accusations against prison <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a>.  Anyone who does
this should be charged with obstruction of justice.
