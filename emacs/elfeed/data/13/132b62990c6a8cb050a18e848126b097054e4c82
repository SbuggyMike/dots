US citizens: call on Congress to act to let the FCC <a href="https://act.freepress.net/sign/support_nn_broadband_justice_act?akid=23755.9489429.Z4INeY&rd=1&t=1002">restore the past
network neutrality requirements</a> on ISPs.
<p>
As explained before, the Obama-era network neutrality requirements
that the corrupter abolished were <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-may-aug.html#21_July_2022_(net_neutrality_and_broadband_justice_act)">weak</a> and <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-sep-dec.html#27_September_2011_(FCC_Network_Neutrality)">inadequate</a>.
Nonetheless, they would do some good.
