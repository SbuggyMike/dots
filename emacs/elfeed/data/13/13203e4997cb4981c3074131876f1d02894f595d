<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is a common misconception that doctors are very rich. Working in the hospitality industry you get paid on average £10/hour, as a junior doctor your starting salary is around £13/hour. So the doctors we all rely upon are literally making life or death decisions for £3 more.</p> <p>A lot of UK doctors, especially GP&#39;s are leaving the NHS to work in Australia, Canada and the USA because of being extremely overworked and underpaid. The pressure on the NHS is already so great so by having doctors leaving its putting more pressure on remaining doctors and putting patients lives at risk.</p> <p>What are peoples thoughts on this and what should the government do about it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Plane_Manufacturer_2"> /u/Plane_Manufacturer_2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/whvxyf/uk_poor_doctors_pay/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/whvxyf/uk_poor_doctors_pay/">[comments]</a></span>
