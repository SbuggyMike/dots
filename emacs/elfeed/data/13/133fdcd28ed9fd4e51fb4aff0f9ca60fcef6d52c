US citizens: call on Biden
to <a href="https://act.winwithoutwar.org/act/no_saudi_arms_sales_july">continue
the policy of refusing to sell offensive weapons to Salafi Arabia</a>.
<p>
It is very disappointing that instead of calling on the president
to take new actions to end US support for <a href="/glossary.html#salafi">Salafi Arabia</a>'s war in
Yemen, we have to campaign against increasing that support.
