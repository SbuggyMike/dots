<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why are these past &quot;legends&quot; so confident in their assertions. Look how ridiculous this statement is. &quot;Axe out 50 over format&quot;. Why do all Pakistanis and Indian past legends think that cricketers were better in the past and the aggressive cricket the modern players are playing is all thanks to rules? Why do they fail to understand that those who could play aggressive cricket also played it in the past? The likes of Dhoni, Sehwag, Yuvraj, Gilchrist, KP, Watson, ABD, Saeed Anwar, Shahid Afridi, VIV Richards and Flintoff played many aggressive innings in the past. Modern rules have their pros and cons. For ex: 90m boundaries, bigger gaps. 60m boundaries, smaller gaps. If the bats are thick, the balls are better than ever. Why are these legends feeling insecure? They think that the quality is declining. Did any of those play such match-winning innings that the youngsters are playing nowadays? Now coming to the Axing odi point. Look what level of entertainment modern ODIs have given us. We have witnessed some of the greatest high and low-scoring thrillers. And Shastri wants it AXED out of cricket? Modern ODI cricket has given a lot. Now, teams sit down for hours to analyse their opposition&#39;s way of playing and make strategies accordingly. Player fitness is now the utmost priority and players don&#39;t get selected unless they clear tests. Players spend hours in Gyms. Coaches now emphasise good fielding. These are some of the things that past players never thought that anyone would expect from them. There is apparent evidence that Cricket is at its best currently but legends think that cricket is declining. I think that these people are just goofuses who think that the cricket they played is the best and they are the only right ones. In the end, all that matters is entertainment and we the fans are getting entertained more than ever. Please share your views on this subject as well. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. This is just my opinion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThinkingSP29"> /u/ThinkingSP29 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w6ragw/ravi_shastri_wants_to_get_test_playing_nations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w6ragw/ravi_shastri_wants_to_get_test_playing_nations/">[comments]</a></span>
