<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a Russian speaker, I am embarrassed for the interpreter at the press conferences. Not only he doesn’t know first thing about chess and as a result mistranslates both the questions and the answers about positions, making a lot of it completely nonsensical, but he also makes jarring mistakes in generic questions which have nothing to do with the chessboard. Why couldn’t they find a half-decent interpreter for such an important event?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Happypotamus13"> /u/Happypotamus13 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132zrad/awful_translation_at_the_wc_postgames/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132zrad/awful_translation_at_the_wc_postgames/">[comments]</a></span>
