<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have two specific situations that I would like to seek the forums input:</p> <p>- Packages that moved from AUR to official repository. Would pacman be able to automatically update the packages if this happens?</p> <p>- Configurations that&#39;s specific to certain software versions. For example the hardware acceleration under Firefox that&#39;s version and X11/Wayland dependent. Apart from checking Arch wiki from time to time, any better solutions out there?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jacosis"> /u/jacosis </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0hlni/how_do_you_keep_your_systems_updated/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0hlni/how_do_you_keep_your_systems_updated/">[comments]</a></span>
