<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>FTX Crypto Cup is starting in 10 days not too far away from where I live. I wanted to go - it would be nice to see Magnus, Alireza and other super GMs. But then I saw that <a href="https://chess24.com/tour/miami/">tickets</a> start at $200 for one day - WTF? And these are &quot;early bird&quot; prices!</p> <p>Is this the norm for super tournaments held in the USA?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/anusoffire"> /u/anusoffire </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wh8eic/are_tickets_to_see_super_tournaments_always_so/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wh8eic/are_tickets_to_see_super_tournaments_always_so/">[comments]</a></span>
