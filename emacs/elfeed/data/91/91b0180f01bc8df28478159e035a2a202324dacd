Here's an example of how concern about Putin's threats against the
Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant get
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/time-to-avert-nuclear-catastrophe-war-escalation-around-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-could-be-disaster-for-all-of-europe">spun into a demand</a>
to give Putin
a victorious conquest.
<p>
Putin has frequently used his capture of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear
power plant in Ukraine for psychplogical warfare.  There is a real
danger that it will lose external power and melt down.  Putin has
chosen to magnify the danger by creating avoidable risk &mdash; by
brinksmanship.
<p>
In response to this brinksmanship, the article calls on the US to
impose a cease fire fast.  The only way to get Putin to agree to that
is to make Ukraine cede to him all the territory that the <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#putinforces">Putin forces</a>
now hold.  (Maybe even that isn't enough to satisfy him.)
<p>
Is this what the author aims for?  He does not admit it outright, but
I can't believe that he is not aware of it.  It has been pointed out
many times.  According to the author, the US should tell Ukraine,
"Surrender fast, so you can have peace!"
<p>
Putin says he demands the whole territory of the provinces of
Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk, in exchange for peace.
If the US were to take the desperate "Surrender, Ukraine" position
that the article recommends, Putin would take advantage of that.
<p>
If we want to avoid a nuclear disaster in the Zaporizhzhia plant, it
is easy to see how a local agreement could do this.  If both sides are
willing, they can easily do it.  Since Putin has refused, it can only
mean he does not want the plant to be made properly safe.  But he
doesn't want a nuclear disaster either.  He wants a threat to make to
set fools scurrying to demand giving him whatever he wants.
