Republicans are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/15/doctor-10-year-old-rape-victim-abortion">lying about and threatening</a> the Indiana doctor
who carried out an abortion on a 10-year-old rape victim,
who was compelled to go Indiana because Ohio's right-wing law
did not allow her to get an abortion there.

Many Republicans now actively defend forcing people who have been
raped to have babies.  It is consistent with their religious beliefs,
and it shows how cruel and arbitrary those beliefs are.
