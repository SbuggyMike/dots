<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I just got Garuda linux (KDE Dragonized Gaming Edition) installed, and my drawing tablet I&#39;m attempting to see if I can get working under wayland is the XP-Pen Innovator 16. I Installed the <code>xp-pen-tablet</code> package from the AUR via the paru package manager, and if information about the specs of my computer is needed it&#39;s located in the screenshot below. One last thing that the screenshot won&#39;t inform you however is that I&#39;m also running a dual monitor setup. </p> <p>Basically my issue is that my stylus is incorrectly proportioned to my tablet screen causing it to be offset and severely misaligned from the actual pointer&#39;s location whenever I try to draw on the screen. This problem doesn&#39;t exist on X11 (though there are other crippling problems X11 currently gets me), and it also seems to go away if I use solely my xp pen tablet as the only monitor/screen and don&#39;t connect my second monitor? But on wayland at least, if I run it with both monitors, that causes the incorrect proportion/offset problem with my stylus and the pointer on the screen. </p> <p>Is anyone else running an xp-pen tablet on arch with a setup similar like mine on wayland (plasma)? Or even happen to use the exact same tablet I&#39;m using with this setup, and experiencing any problems similar to this yourself? Or is there something I&#39;m missing that I should do to attempt to fix this? I&#39;ve tried playing around with the xp-pen menu and setting the screen/pen area there but to no avail.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dknujvnfz1k7pg/Screenshot_5.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dknujvnfz1k7pg/Screenshot_5.png?dl=0</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Present_Memory3469"> /u/Present_Memory3469 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w999jz/xp_pen_tablet_on_wayland/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w999jz/xp_pen_tablet_on_wayland/">[comments]</a></span>
