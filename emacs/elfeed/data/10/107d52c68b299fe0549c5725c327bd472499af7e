<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I made the decision to switch to arch from windows 10. I think the problem was that i went for a UEFI install instead of a non-UEFI install. When I went to continue on I got an error about not having UEFI or something. I freaked out and thought I messed it up... but I only made it worse. I think I wiped the drive to try and partition it again this time as a non_UEFI method. I went to pacstrap and just recieved a bunch of errors and warnings. Am I screwed here or can I save this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SargeDesu"> /u/SargeDesu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1396j5p/is_there_a_way_to_reatart_my_install_process/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1396j5p/is_there_a_way_to_reatart_my_install_process/">[comments]</a></span>
