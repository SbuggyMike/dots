<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I am running Arch Linux with tkg-pds for lesser latency and the nvidia-dkms drivers, which are proprietary. I have installed all dependencies and 32-bit drivers too, but still get terrible performance, like FPS drops, and battery discharging even while laptop is plugged in, this never happens on Windows 11. Can someone help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/amogusdri-"> /u/amogusdri- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg6oro/really_terrible_performance_with_nvidia_drivers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wg6oro/really_terrible_performance_with_nvidia_drivers/">[comments]</a></span>
