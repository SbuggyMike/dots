<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So far I&#39;ve had a few ideas of fun challenges to give my students. Tasks I&#39;ve given them so far are to grep the man to find and find the man to grep. Make doom run on their linux vm. With absolutely no help I&#39;ve also told them to find a way to the linux channel of freenode irc. </p> <p>These students are just starting out and each of these tasks teach them some basic skills and gets them used to working in the terminal. What are some other tasks I can give them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Atuday"> /u/Atuday </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/138433p/ideas_to_challenge_my_linux_college_students/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/138433p/ideas_to_challenge_my_linux_college_students/">[comments]</a></span>
