<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I just installed arch for the first time today and after I installed it pacman keeps giving me “failed receiving file” and “too many errors from _____mirror”. Does anyone know how to fix this, or what I did wrong? It has happened twice now, both times a little bit after installation. Thank you for your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JJSLAYER_"> /u/JJSLAYER_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vxtie2/i_need_help_with_pacman/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vxtie2/i_need_help_with_pacman/">[comments]</a></span>
