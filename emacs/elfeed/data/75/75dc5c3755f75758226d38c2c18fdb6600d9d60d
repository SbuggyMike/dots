<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;ve gotten most of what I want out of my egpu. I can use monitors from the egpu, and I can assign apps to use the egpu for actual graphics work with prime-run. However, I&#39;m having issues with hot-unplugging. I tried enabling the NVIDIA persistence daemon (as the Arch wiki suggests), and it hasn&#39;t helped. Any ideas for what I lack to get this working?
