<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, fellow cricketers </p> <p>I&#39;m from Brazil and as you know theres almost no cricket here, that&#39;s why I&#39;m relatively new in cricket (play about a year). I receive an award in my club for being the Rookie of the year and everyone are encouraging me to play. They say I&#39;m a good fielder and especially a good batsman. In practice I can score sometimes 40, 50 runs even against experienced players (from Australia, New Zealand and england). We practice every Sunday and once in a month we have an internal match. In practice I play loose and I have a lot of fun, because I know if I&#39;m out = no problem, I can continue to bat. But in the games I don&#39;t feel any joy because I&#39;m worried about being out early. We travel to play in a great field (1Â½ hour) and we pay to play. So, once I was out with 0 runs and I felt terrible. Not just because my score, but because I could barely play. What should I do to enjoy game as much as practice?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PeteZM"> /u/PeteZM </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1336z7a/anxious_batsman/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1336z7a/anxious_batsman/">[comments]</a></span>
