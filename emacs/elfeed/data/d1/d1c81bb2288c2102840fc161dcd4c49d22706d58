<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Being a Rachmaninoff enthusiast.. I was listening to Rach 3 by Horowitz (NYP, Eugene Ormandy) just as usual.. and I heard a weird artifact by the end of movement 2.</p> <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1JJAWpI5tOAXGIBhmgk5T4?si=ZKOBZ5I8T1Swteikhxiuhg&amp;utm_source=copy-link">https://open.spotify.com/track/1JJAWpI5tOAXGIBhmgk5T4?si=ZKOBZ5I8T1Swteikhxiuhg&amp;utm_source=copy-link</a></p> <p>Between 11:00-11:10, USE HEADPHONES and listen VERY carefully. Easy to miss. Two phrases are spoken, with about a second in between.</p> <p>Obviously it is some kind of error in recording, or a conductor saying something might have slipped in, nothing too serious but it sounds kind of funny. Anyone have any idea what it might be &quot;saying?&quot; And mostly, can you hear it too?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zestyclose-League-74"> /u/Zestyclose-League-74 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wcjy49/weird_artifact_in_horowitz_rach_3_recording/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wcjy49/weird_artifact_in_horowitz_rach_3_recording/">[comments]</a></span>
