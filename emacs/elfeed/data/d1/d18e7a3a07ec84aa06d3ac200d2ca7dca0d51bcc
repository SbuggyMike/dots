<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Started playing about a year ago, without doing a ton of studying or anything I hit 1300 today. I went on a run yesterday where I won 18 of 21 games and went from around 1150 to 1307. Ended up getting to 1332 and beat someone that was ranked 1416. I’m pumped. Here’s to getting to 1400!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dashiznit364"> /u/Dashiznit364 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wft6ny/it_might_not_be_much_but_i_hit_1300_on_chesscom/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wft6ny/it_might_not_be_much_but_i_hit_1300_on_chesscom/">[comments]</a></span>
