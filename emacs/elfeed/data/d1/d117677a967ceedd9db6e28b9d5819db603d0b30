<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Hey everyone!</h1> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>So long story short: Years ago when I was at a German restaurant, I heard a recording of a slow, beautiful, and romantic classical-german ballad orchestra piece with a violin solo feature. (and it&#39;s NOT a concerto, it&#39;s a concertmaster solo feature). I don&#39;t even know what the title is, or who composed it. But let me give you a few details about the unknown piece in general.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ol> <li>It starts off with a woodwind interlude before the soloist begins.</li> <li>The piece is somewhat in 3/4 time, and has an adagio pace]</li> <li>It&#39;s primarily in D Major, but towards the end, there&#39;s a full huge grand symphonic build up to the final G Major chord.</li> </ol> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><em>So if any of you can help me out with this, please do so.</em></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <h1>Thank you.</h1> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AriannaC0807"> /u/AriannaC0807 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wiv6jg/whats_that_one_slow_romantic_orchestral_ballad/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wiv6jg/whats_that_one_slow_romantic_orchestral_ballad/">[comments]</a></span>
