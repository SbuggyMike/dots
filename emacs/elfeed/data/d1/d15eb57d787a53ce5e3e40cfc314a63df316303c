<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m not a professional, I just have a shithouse level church music certificate, but in the past I’ve sometimes done arrangements for friends, so I was thinking about maybe doing this type of thing on fiverr or similar platforms. </p> <p>Does anyone have any idea what adequate pricing for that would be (from a non-professional hack like me)? Either for harmonizing an existing melody (+adding voices) or for just copying down sheet music from audio recordings etc.? I was thinking maybe 5€ for up to 3 pages, 10€ for 3-6 pages or is that too steep? No idea what to aim for here. I’m a college student (non music) so that’s not nothing to me, and I don’t want to overprice. </p> <p>(Sorry if this is the wrong sub, I thought maybe people here have experience with that kind of thing.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/millers_left_shoe"> /u/millers_left_shoe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13j1mhb/what_kind_of_pricing_would_make_sense_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13j1mhb/what_kind_of_pricing_would_make_sense_for/">[comments]</a></span>
