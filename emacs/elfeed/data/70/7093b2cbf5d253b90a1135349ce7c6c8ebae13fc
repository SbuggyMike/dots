<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I play chesscom rapid and am currently stuck in the 1200s despite having played 1100 games. I know a lot of people who have made it way higher with way less experience and zero study, and I regularly lose to people who have only played 50-300 total games on the site.</p> <p>I&#39;m kind of upset because it seems like I&#39;m lacking in innate ability or intelligence here. It&#39;s taking me so much longer to achieve results that are worse than what others achieve effortlessly. Problem is, the whole reason I got into chess was because I&#39;m not good at anything else (they kind of went the same way as chess - I suck despite more effort and experience), and I&#39;d just like to have at least one thing I can do well. If I had something else, I&#39;d probably just quit because it seems like chess isn&#39;t my thing. But I don&#39;t, so it seems like I&#39;m stuck.</p> <p>I&#39;m basically in stalemate. I have no moves. I can&#39;t quit - I think it&#39;s a fairly human thing to want to be good at SOMETHING, but at the same time, I most likely can&#39;t be good at chess - at least not without 100x the effort of everyone else in which case I&#39;m not actually good, just desperate. And everything else has gone even worse than chess so I can&#39;t pick something else to try to improve at. So I&#39;m trapped, with literally no course of action I can take, which is why I&#39;m making this post. I just don&#39;t know what to do. Anyone see a move I don&#39;t? Other than some experimental talent-enhancing brain surgery - though I&#39;d be open to hearing about that if you know of one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HardstuckBronzeRank"> /u/HardstuckBronzeRank </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/weuphb/slow_improvement/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/weuphb/slow_improvement/">[comments]</a></span>
