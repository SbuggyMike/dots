*Shocking messages about
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/19/antioch-police-department-racist-text-messages">beating suspects and making up evidence</a>
were found when Antioch, [California], [<a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a>] were investigated.*
  Nearly half the <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> in the department either sent them or read them
without objecting.

The article linked to just above displays symbolic bigotry by
capitalizing "black" but not "white".  (To avoid endorsing bigotry,
capitalize both words or neither one.)  I denounce bigotry, and
normally I will not link to articles that promote it.  But I make
exceptions for some articles that I consider particularly important.
That article is one of the exceptions.
<p>
The point of the article is that we have a responsibility to object to
bigotry when we see it.  Symbolic bigotry is nowhere near as bad as
beating people up, but we should still call it out, as I am doing here.
