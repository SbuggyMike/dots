<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the past few months, I&#39;ve used Emacs 28.1 (compiled from the official release tarball) with no <em>apparent</em> bugs. I&#39;ve primarily used Debian Unstable, but I&#39;ve also tried this on Fedora 36 and Arch. Changing from gcc11 to gcc12 doesn&#39;t change the situation.</p> <p>It seems that no matter what dependencies I install or which configuration options I provide, my compiled Emacs will never pass a handful of the tests provided by <code>make check-all</code>.</p> <p>Why is this the case? Has anyone managed to run &#39;make check-all&#39; without any resulting failures, and if so, how? Are the failed tests in levels above &#39;make check&#39; telling me anything significant?</p> <p>--Editing to fix formatting and (hopefully) simplify my question--</p> <p>Here&#39;s the result of running make check-all after compiling with the <code>--with-xwidgets</code> option:</p> <pre><code>SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS ----------------------- Files examined: 375 Ran 5568 tests, 1 failed to run, 5456 results as expected, 13 unexpected, 99 skipped 1 files did not finish: misc/test-custom-noloads.log 7 files contained unexpected results: src/thread-tests.log lisp/progmodes/python-tests.log lisp/mail/rmailmm-tests.log lisp/emacs-lisp/cconv-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/fields-tests.log lisp/cedet/srecode/document-tests.log lisp/autorevert-tests.log make[2]: *** [Makefile:336: check-doit] Error 2 make[2]: Leaving directory &#39;/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test&#39; make[1]: *** [Makefile:315: check-all] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory &#39;/home/src/emacs/emacs-28.1-tarball/emacs-28.1/test&#39; make: *** [Makefile:994: check-all] Error 2 </code></pre> <p>All the tests that fail are performed only when I run <code>make check-all</code>. They aren&#39;t run for <code>make check</code> or <code>make check-expensive</code>. I&#39;ll post more information in the comments shortly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/colemacsen"> /u/colemacsen </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vwh7ds/significance_of_failed_tests_in_emacs_281_make/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vwh7ds/significance_of_failed_tests_in_emacs_281_make/">[comments]</a></span>
