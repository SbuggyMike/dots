<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello.</p> <p>As the title suggests, I am looking for things to wear when I perform. I am in my second year of undergrad and this is really the first time I have to consider what to wear for performances especially for my junior and senior recitals. I am not someone who typically likes dresses or skirts and instead opts for pants and a top of some sort or go for a suit. The problem is, I cannot find pictures of female musicians to get attire inspirations.</p> <p>Are there some musicians that typically wear what I am describing if so, may I have some names? If you are someone in a similar boat as I am, could you DM me on some things you wear?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> <p>*I am an oboist for instrumental context</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Special_Chard_9714"> /u/Special_Chard_9714 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/waf9pc/what_are_some_performance_attire_options_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/waf9pc/what_are_some_performance_attire_options_for/">[comments]</a></span>
