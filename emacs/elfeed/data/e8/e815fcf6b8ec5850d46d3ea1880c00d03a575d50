<p>Because Álvaro Ramírez has been building so many useful packages and applications lately, I’ve been writing about him a lot. I’ve always thought his Emacs theme looked nice despite the fact that it’s a dark theme. The minions, of course, are tut tutting about this and demanding that the heathens be cast out but I’m more sanguine.</p>
<p>Although I still <i>much</i> prefer a light theme, it’s nonetheless true that his theme has good contrast and is readable unlike many dark themes. Now you can see this for yourself. Ramírez has posted <a href="https://xenodium.com/my-emacs-eye-candy/">My Emacs eye candy</a>, which describes his Emacs theme and its configuration.</p>
<p>He uses the <a href="https://github.com/cpaulik/emacs-material-theme">Material</a> theme but has made <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/790465b1824481b81bf5c6e08949128c13d76f95/emacs/features/fe-ui.el#L42">many custom tweaks to it</a>. If you must use a dark theme and don’t mind constant hectoring from the minions, his example is a good one to follow. He uses the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a> typeface. It’s nice looking and distinguishes between zero and oh; ell, one, and eye; and comma and period. I’ve been using the <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata">inconsolata</a> font for at least 15 years and have been very happy with it but either is a good choice.</p>
<p>He has many other small customizations including the execrable (sorry) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat">Nyan Cat</a>, tweaks to the minibuffer, the Welcome screen, and a few others. Again, if you’re looking for a nice Emacs configuration using a dark theme, Ramírez’s is a good place to start. Or you could abandon the dark side and come back to truth, light, and goodness.</p>
