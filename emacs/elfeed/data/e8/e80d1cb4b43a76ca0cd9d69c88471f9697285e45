<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, just wondering, is this intended, and why?</p> <p>I already have a virt-manager set up with the one VM i&#39;m using, but thought i&#39;d give gnome boxes a try.</p> <p>But it wants to remove qemu-full... </p> <p>Is this intended behaviour? I thought, gnome-boxes relies on qemu and all that to function. Is it not possible to install both? How come? </p> <p>And of course, i i remove qemu-full, is there something to replace it that&#39;ll make both boxes and virt-manager function?</p> <p>Thanks for the input!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Veprovina"> /u/Veprovina </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1394g72/gnome_boxes_conflicts_with_qemufull/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1394g72/gnome_boxes_conflicts_with_qemufull/">[comments]</a></span>
