Including 10 billion for Bezos.

*We're talking about giving $50 billion in corporate welfare with no
strings attached &mdash; a blank check &mdash; to the highly profitable
microchip industry.*

It makes sense to encourage companies to manufacture chips in the US,
but not with a subsidy.  We must stop "rewarding" companies for <em>not</em>
doing some harmful practice.  Instead we must punish the ones that do
it.
<p>
The traditional way to do this is with a tariff.  The World Trade
Organization restricts that &mdash; its purpose, from the start, was
to reduce the power that states have over businesses and give
the businesses power over states, and it succeeded.  That's
why I call it a <a href="/business-supremacy-treaties.html">business-supremacy treaty</a>.
But there are ways to impose a tariff.
<p>
The problem is that when a country applies a tariff to a product that
it does not produce, it only <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2018-mar-jun.html#15_June_2018_(Solar_power_projects_canceled)">discourages use of the product</a>.
What we
need is a tariff that applies to any given model of imported chips
<em>once some factory in the US produces comparable chips</em>.
