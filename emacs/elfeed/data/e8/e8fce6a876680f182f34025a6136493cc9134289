<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>People say &quot;If your X hangs, do sysrq+K and be happy&quot;. Now, you, disable please your display manager, go to — say — tty2, login and <code>startx</code>. Now wait until you&#39;re in your graphical environment and press Alt+Sysrq+K. How do you like it? Just type your username and password again and <code>startx</code>. You have to do it blind, but when X starts again it fix things.</p> <p>Why the hell does it happen? It is case not only with Arch, I tried Debian 11 and the same thing. Also it is not specific to window manager. Maybe it&#39;s hardware issue?</p> <p>If nothing happens to you, I&#39;ll elaborate. After doing Alt+Sysrq+K I am sent back to console and then screen goes dead. It shows text it showed before X overtook console, but it does not respond to keyboard in any ways. sysrq+v doesn&#39;t help. But if I blindly login and restart X things fix. I fancy it has something to do with KMS not managed properly due to aggressive nature of the sysrq combination, but this is stupid, honestly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmErAJ1D"> /u/EmErAJ1D </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfbrku/sysrq_uno_reverse_behavior_makes_things_worse/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfbrku/sysrq_uno_reverse_behavior_makes_things_worse/">[comments]</a></span>
