  A billionaire Republican hedge-fund founder <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/11/harvard-republican-donor-kenneth-griffin">tries to buy elections</a>,
and perhaps has succeeded.  He did succeed in buying the naming rights
of Harvard's general graduate school.

I expect the students and faculty will have their say now, and I hope
their condemnation of that Republican will live longer than he does.

When the MIT AI Lab moved to the Stata Center, and I discovered that one
of the two towers was named Bill Gates, I urged people to refuse
to call it by that name.  I suggested Minas Tirith and Minas Morgul,
but people settled on the innocuous "D Tower" and "G Tower".
<p>
I also made a practice of formally saluting the sign that says "Bill
Gates", near the outside door of the G tower, with my middle finger.
<p>
Methods like this can certainly be used against another billionaire donor
who has harmed people's freedom.
