<p>&#8216;Local government is an aspect of UK constitutional law that is often neglected or overlooked. Councils, though, are a vital part of our governmental order, providing the services and opportunities, and making the decisions and policies, that shape a large part of our day-to-day lives. They are also the institutions of government with which the population interact most frequently. Local government across the UK, however, is hampered by the constitutional system of which it is part. The predominance of the sovereign Parliament and the lack of any codified constitutional provision means that councils in the UK are at the mercy of the centre and that they do not enjoy any protection from easy change, manipulation or prescription. This has a profound effect on the way in which councils operate, as my new book, “Law, Localism, and the Constitution: A Comparative Perspective”, explores.&#8217;</p>
