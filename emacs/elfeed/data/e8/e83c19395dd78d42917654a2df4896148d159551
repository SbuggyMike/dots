  Toronto homeless shelters require security guards to remove facial
  hair so that N95 masks will fit them well, and effectively prevent
  transmission of Covid-19.  This rule is to protect health and safety
  during Covid waves.
<p>
  Some guards, who are Sikhs, believe that this rule is unfair to them
  because complying with it would go against their religion.  They 
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/05/toronto-sikh-security-guards-fired-facial-hair-policy">contend that the state has no right to enforce rules on them
  that conflict with their religious observance</a>.
<p>
  Such a demand must be refused.  No one is entitled to set aside a
  requirement to protect other people's health in order to practice a
  ritual.  In the end, if you won't do the job as it needs to be done,
  you must leave.
<p>
  In general, we should let people practice their religions when it
  doesn't cause a significant problem.  For instance, <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2016-jul-oct.html#24_August_2016_(Burkini_bans_in_France)">if someone wants
  to wear a long bathing suit while swimming, there is no reason to
  forbid that</a>.
<p>
  It is also good to look for compromises, including with the Sikh
  guards.  For instance, a small beard, like the one I wear now, can fit
  under an N95 mask.  (I cut it to fit underneath.)  Such beards should
  be permitted.  Whether that is acceptable to a Sikh, I don't know, but
  if it is, they should be allowed to wear their masks over these
  beards.
<p>
  It is reasonable to insist that an employer offer a worker some other
  job, when a new rule excludes per from per current job.  But people
  with a religion should not thereby acquire more human rights than
  Atheists have.
