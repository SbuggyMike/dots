<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>While operations like pulling in my Inbox causes everything to momentarily freeze, I could live with this.</p> <p>But, sometimes, Wanderlust will just freeze without provocation and I&#39;ll end up having to dump my Emacs and open it, again.</p> <p>This can consistently happen, without fail, if the internet connection drops (which, unfortunately, mine does often).</p> <p>Does anyone know of any workaround for this? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a fair comparison or not but I actually don&#39;t remember Gnus locking up my Emacs, at all (or, at least, in any way that didn&#39;t pass relatively soon), let alone causing a crash.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blah1998z"> /u/blah1998z </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfieuq/wanderlust_email_client_keeps_freezing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfieuq/wanderlust_email_client_keeps_freezing/">[comments]</a></span>
