<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, apologies for the second thread in a row. However I need to discuss this with somebody. </p> <p>I am running on a PC (not a laptop if that is somehow relevant) and I experience quite some lag while typing in any text prompt in my browser and Discord (currently lagging while I am texting you here)</p> <p>I am also running KDE Plasma under Wayland so it might be also possibly that it is a Wayland issue, however I would be happy if anybody has any suggestions on what this might be.</p> <p>Here is my system info: OS: Arch Linux x86_64 Kernel: 6.1.27-1-lts DE: Plasma 5.27.4 WM: kwin Theme: [Plasma], Breeze [GTK2/3] Intel i3-8350K (4) @ 4.000GHz GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB Memory: 15934MiB </p> <p>My keyboard in particular is a standard USB Keyboard from Redragon or something.</p> <p>To explain my issue further, when I type the keyboard just... lags? Or the browser itself hangs while I type. It doesn&#39;t happen all the time however which is the weird part.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gospodishere"> /u/gospodishere </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138u5gb/issues_with_using_my_keyboard_in_brave_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138u5gb/issues_with_using_my_keyboard_in_brave_and/">[comments]</a></span>
