<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m trying to install Arch on my laptop but I ran into a roadblock. I partitioned the disk and all but when i try to format (mkfs.ext) the partitions it says that the partition didn&#39;t exist. How can I possibly fix this?</p> <p>When I use fdisk /dev/nvme0n1p4 -l, it shows that the partitions I created exist. But when I use lsblk, it does not show up.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThisMhiw"> /u/ThisMhiw </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131z7y6/cant_format_the_partitions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131z7y6/cant_format_the_partitions/">[comments]</a></span>
