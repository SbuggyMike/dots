<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This arose in the Asahi Linux sub. To answer a question on difficulty I used a 7-point scale. Happy for this group to comment.</p> <p>The scale is subjective and draws on your own ability and all things you might do on a computer. </p> <p>Itâ€™s called the R-PITAS. Based on the Clinical Global Impression Scale which has a link here:</p> <pre><code>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_Global_Impression </code></pre> <p>Le Scale:</p> <p>Reid Pain In The Neck Scale.</p> <p>1 no difficulty.</p> <p>2 subtle or borderline difficulty.</p> <p>3 mild difficulty. </p> <p>4 moderate difficulty. </p> <p>5 marked difficulty, as if difficulty is the thing something people would comment on when describing it.</p> <p>6 severely difficult, interfering with other computer activities that day.</p> <p>7 among the most extremely difficult software installs, disruptive to the rest of my life.</p> <p>For me:</p> <p>Installing Ubuntu from a cd is a 2.</p> <p>Asahi Linux is a 3. </p> <p>Installing Arch is a 4, but a 5 if you have yanky BIOS or wifi problem. </p> <p>Forgetting my Apple password and needing to use my phone to to reset my account so I can download an app for my relative is a 5.</p> <p>Windows rebooting halfway through my dissertation with an update that obsoletes my laptop is a 6.</p> <p>Anything to do with printers is a 6. </p> <p>Discuss.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/keithreid-sfw"> /u/keithreid-sfw </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w49hpl/a_difficulty_scale_for_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w49hpl/a_difficulty_scale_for_linux/">[comments]</a></span>
