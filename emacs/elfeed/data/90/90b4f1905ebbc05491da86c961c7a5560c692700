<p>Yesterday all the students at Ca’ Foscari university received an email from the
Educational Programmes and Student Services Area Manager of the school. The key
content of the email is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2022/2023 classes at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice will be delivered
exclusively in person.</p>

  <p>Emergency teaching methods such as dual, synchronous or
asynchronous lessons will not be provided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been thinking about this email since I first read it. Despite being
predictable behaviour from an institution who has never really wanted to act
differently, there are other things to consider.</p>

<p>First, Ca’ Foscari is blatantly ignoring the new peaks of COVID-19 infections in
order to be “consistent with the values that we have always recognised and
upheld in recent years: the relationship between students and faculty . . .”.
However, how much do they really value this “relationship”? The email states
that the classroom capacity will be back to 100%, and yet without any rule in
place to enforce the use of masks I am left to wonder why security and health
are so easily overlooked. What’s even more fascinating is that the Italian
healthcare institute released an official bulletin documenting the raising
numbers of infections on June 24<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://manueluberti.eu/feed.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, right within the range of days when the
Conference of Italian Universities Rectors (on June 22) and then the Regional
Monitoring Committee (on June 27) agreed upon delivering classes exclusively in
person.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it’s not clear what is going to happen to the technology and the
services that have been built and maintained during the last two years. Most of
the professors are openly against remote classes and lesson registrations, so
they did it reluctantly and, more often than not, without bothering to learn how
to use the tools at their disposal. Students did not help in this regard either.
Among the ones online with me during the lessons, many participated with both
camera and microphone turned off the entire time, thus forcing teachers to stare
at walls of black squares on their Zoom window. The problem here, as I see it,
is two-fold: on the one hand, if you are a teacher and your university forces
you to use certain tools it also has to provide decent training. I cannot expect
all the professors in humanities to be familiar with multiple screens or Zoom
breakout rooms, for instance. However, Zoom is not Emacs. If you are still
hitting the wrong button after, say, ten lessons, then the issue might be found
somewhere between the chair and the keyboard. On the other hand, students not
willing to be a part of the lesson from remote should just be kicked out of the
session. I know this sounds brutal, but I took time off my daily job to do my
best and be at every possible online lesson, asking questions, interacting with
professors, and in general making the most of it. I seriously doubt that every
student with a black square in their place was actually unable to do something
about it.</p>

<p>Eventually Ca’ Foscari is about to forget the progress it has made in the last
two years by enabling students such as myself to be seriously engaged with the
faculty. It’s fairly obvious to me that when they talk about “the relationship
between students and faculty” they have a precise idea of who these “students”
should be. This unwillingness to compromise is making me question my willingness
to compromise. I was willing to accept their Google-owned platforms and their
Zoom because, despite the poor technological choice, work was being done to
bring people in instead of keeping them out. Am I willing to continue with the
compromise now?</p>
