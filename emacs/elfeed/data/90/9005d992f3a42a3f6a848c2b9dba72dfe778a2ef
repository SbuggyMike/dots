<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To some of you this may be obvious, but for a long time I wondered why when GM’s are playing chess and they’re deciding what to do, they look away. I thought “ sure, they have the ability to play blindfolded, but wouldn’t it be easier to decide what to do while you’re staring at the board anyway? Why do the extra work of imagining the entire board in your head if it’s in front of you?” But the other day I was doing a Chess puzzle and I tried to imagine a line that I wanted to play and I realized that it was harder to do that while looking at the board because the pieces I’m looking at on the board make it hard for me to visualize the alternative lines. You’re trying to imagine that the pawn that is there is no longer there because in your imaginary line you took it, opening a diagonal for a bishop, and so on. Now, of course, since I’m not really good at playing blindfolded, my ability to imagine alternative lines in my head is very limited. Which is why I become more and more convinced that being able to play blindfolded is an essential part of becoming a grandmaster.</p> <p>Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dr_Nepo"> /u/Dr_Nepo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wjb3wf/i_think_i_finally_understand_why_gms_look_away/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wjb3wf/i_think_i_finally_understand_why_gms_look_away/">[comments]</a></span>
