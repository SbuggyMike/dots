<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want lockfiles to be created outside of the working directory, and so I have added the following part into my <code>init.el</code>, right from the manual:</p> <pre><code>;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/File-Locks.html (setq lock-file-name-transforms &#39;((&quot;\\`/.*/\\([^/]+\\)\\&#39;&quot; &quot;~/.emacs.d/lockfiles/\\1&quot; t))) ;; just in case... (make-directory &quot;~/.emacs.d/lockfiles/&quot; t) </code></pre> <p>However, it doesn&#39;t work. Lockfiles (<code>.#file.ext</code>) are still created in the same directory where I edit the file itself. Why?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/john_smith_007"> /u/john_smith_007 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w7kvwo/to_create_lockfiles_outside_of_the_working/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w7kvwo/to_create_lockfiles_outside_of_the_working/">[comments]</a></span>
