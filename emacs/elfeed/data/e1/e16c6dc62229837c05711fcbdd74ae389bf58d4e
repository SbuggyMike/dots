<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was a little surprised to see WGM Gong Qianyun name in the Singapore team, playing in the Open section. Then I thought maybe Singapore did not send a women’s team which I was also wrong because they did send a team. Actually, WGM Gong Qianyun is ranked 5th strongest overall in Singapore, so it is should come as a surprise at all.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Curious, I searched to find more Women playing in the Open section too. There is a lot to be said about sex segregation in Chess, and even China’s Hou Yifan, declined to participate in the Women World Championship, and eventually retired, as she felt the system with such a drastically different prize structure for women. For example, China’s Ju Wenjun became world champion and got less than 10% of Carlsen’s prize winnings when Carlsen defeated Caruana.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Anyway, it’s refreshing to see Women playing in the Open section – somewhat breaking the traditional segregation barrier. Was looking for an all women team but there was none, with only Luxemberg having 2 female team members. Tell me if you know if previous Olympiads had an ALL women team playing the Open section.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>A total of 13 women are taking part in the Open section, they are:</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>* Laia Swaminathan ( from Cayman Islands)</p> <p>* Women International Master Fiona Steil-Antoni (from Luxembourg)</p> <p>* P’Delle’P Stanley (from Saint Kitts and Nevis)</p> <p>* Celia M Rodriguez Guevara (from Cape Verde)</p> <p>* Gerda Nevska (from Guernsey)</p> <p>* WFM master Zuzana Kovacova (from Bermuda)</p> <p>* Woman Candidate Master Polina Karelina (from Bahamas)</p> <p>* Woman Grand Master Qianyun Gong (from Singapore)</p> <p>* Woman Grand Master Tatiana Dornbusch (from Monaco)</p> <p>* Careen Cuffy-Jules (from British Virgin Islands)</p> <p>* Mia Burth (from British Virgin Islands)</p> <p>* WFM master Alshaeby Boshra (from Jordan)</p> <p>* Woman Grand Master Elvira Berend (from Luxemberg)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Also did a video on this (same content but with pictures and some narration) but I cannot promote my content with a link according to <a href="/r/chess">r/chess</a> rules but you can Google it with the same title as this post if interested.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Live_Upstairs"> /u/Live_Upstairs </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbl0ug/chennai_olympiads_women_in_open_section/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbl0ug/chennai_olympiads_women_in_open_section/">[comments]</a></span>
