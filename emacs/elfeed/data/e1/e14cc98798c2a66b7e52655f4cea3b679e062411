<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>tl;dr: Pulseeffect has a pretty good equalizer that actually works.</p> <p>Ubuntu 20.04.4</p> <p>I got myself some new headphones, which are dominant and clear in high frequencies and hide their potential in the lower. So I installed pulseaudio-equalizer, did the tweaking, listening to music was nice again. But every system-sound was interfering with the audio output, it choked and skipped like half a second. I tried a few settings for the real-time stream clock and browsed through <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting">Pulseaudio&#39;s Troubleshoot page</a>, thought to have working config, rebooted, same issue again, so I couldn&#39;t find a proper solution. Sure, I might figure it out, but after 2 days of occasional research it wasn&#39;t worth the time anymore for such a general tool that should just work out of the box. pulse-equalizer also needed to be started on every reboot to be active, and the GUI needed to stay open to apply the EQ. Also, my mic input was messed up, which might have been caused by some pulsemixer tweaks I made, I don&#39;t know anymore. Before every call I literally needed to reboot my machine to make the mic work again. Maybe restarting the pulse-services with systemctl would&#39;ve been enough.</p> <p>So I searched for alternatives.</p> <p>Then I found a video for PulseEffect on Ubuntu 20.04. It&#39;s a guide to install PulseEffects on your machine. First I cleaned up my previous pulseaudio settings.</p> <pre><code>sudo apt purge pulseaudio-equalizer # removes the old EQ # the order in which the services are stopped is important systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.service systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.socket rm -rf .config/pulse # removes all pulse configurations pulseaudio --start # creates new default config &amp; launches service + socket </code></pre> <p>Then I installed pulseeffects and the <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1355630/how-can-i-activate-settings-for-the-equalizer-in-pulseeffects">lsp-plugins</a>.</p> <pre><code>sudo apt install pulseeffects # the software itself sudo apt install lsp-plugins # contains the equalizer plugin </code></pre> <p>And it worked. It just did. I checked the box to launch the service on login and don&#39;t care about it anymore. For headless systems this is no solution afaik, since it operates via GUI and their <code>~/.config/pulse/</code> files are binary.</p> <p>Edit: Maybe that issue with system-sounds in pulseaudio-equalizer was only related to Spotify. I don&#39;t remember if it occurred with other sources. Please leave a note if you had a similar issue with other sources, so I don&#39;t blame pulseaudio-equalizer for no reason.</p> <p>Edit2: This post can also be interpreted as a call for help on that system-sound related issue with pulseaudio-equalizer.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vergus_dalanea"> /u/vergus_dalanea </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3kzd0/an_alternative_to_pulseequalizer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3kzd0/an_alternative_to_pulseequalizer/">[comments]</a></span>
