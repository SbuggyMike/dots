<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. I have a dual boot system with Arch Linux and Windows 10. My partition table looks like this, I use single number for easy description, they all start with nvmen0p_ though:</p> <pre><code>1) EFI partition (/boot/efi) 2) Microsoft Reserve 3) Microsoft Data (main C drive here) 4) Windows Recovery 5) /boot 6) /root 7) swap 8) timeshift partition (normal ext4 partition dedicate to save timeshift files). </code></pre> <p>My Linux root partition is encrypted using LUKS. </p> <p>I am getting a new laptop with 2 SSD, so Im gonna delete Windows 10 on this disk, make it fully Linux and insert it into the other laptop&#39;s 2nd SSD drive. </p> <p>So, I would like to expand my existing partition, in particular /root. So I would imagine that 1),2),3) and 4) would be gone after I manually delete those partitions? So my new partition table would look like this?</p> <pre><code>1) /boot 2) /root 3) swap 4) timeshift partition </code></pre> <p>I believe that there would be a &quot;free space&quot; left behind from Windows 10. How would I expand /root (LUKS encrypted) to occupy those freespace? I ask because when partitioning the disk for the 1st time, the sectors start and stop next to each other. In other words, 2 starts where 1 ends and so on and so forth. </p> <p>What&#39;s the best way to do this? Thanks for any suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maxle0312"> /u/maxle0312 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w48c4h/looking_for_optimal_ways_to_expand_the_existing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w48c4h/looking_for_optimal_ways_to_expand_the_existing/">[comments]</a></span>
