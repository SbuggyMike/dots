<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using OSS my whole life and professional career, and finally have $500 USD to donate to OSS projects. I already sponsor a handful of developers directly on GitHub, but wanted to make a one-time donation. How is my money best spent? Should I make multiple small donations, or fewer larger donations? Here are my thoughts so far.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/projects/">Software in the Public Interest</a> (SPI) controls the finances for a ton of projects I use (Arch, Debian, ffmpeg, LibreOffice, OpenZFS, PostgreSQL, systemd), so I think $250 to them is fair. With SPI I think you can select organizations or have your donation split evenly. </li> <li>I don&#39;t want to donate to Mozilla. <a href="https://loganmarchione.com/2022/08/i-tried-to-quit-firefox-i-cant/#mozilla-foundation-vs-corporation">I&#39;ve written about this already</a>, but if you don&#39;t know, donations go to Mozilla Foundation (an advocacy group), not Mozilla Corporation (the entity that has engineers that develop Firefox). Also, Mitchell Baker&#39;s salary is already offensive to begin with.</li> <li>I might send $50 to <a href="https://give.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Thunderbird</a> (which can directly accept donations, unlike Firefox).</li> <li>I use KDE on the desktop, so maybe $100 to <a href="https://relate.kde.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=9">KDE</a>.</li> </ul> <p>That leaves $100 left. Maybe split between <a href="https://curl.se/donation.html">curl</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/jellyfin">Jellyfin</a>, <a href="https://donate.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/keepassxc">KeePassXC</a>, <a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=2">Python Software Foundation</a>, etc...? Who do you donate to?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lmm7425"> /u/lmm7425 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13072jq/want_to_donate_to_oss_where_should_it_go_multiple/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13072jq/want_to_donate_to_oss_where_should_it_go_multiple/">[comments]</a></span>
