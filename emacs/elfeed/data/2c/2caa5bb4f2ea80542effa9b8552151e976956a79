The bigger things are listed in the &quot;Project status&quot; section of the scripts README (not the repo&#39;s one).</p> <p>Please let me know what you think in the comments</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SkyyySi"> /u/SkyyySi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4kjjh/just_something_i_wanted_to_share_i_made_an/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4kjjh/just_something_i_wanted_to_share_i_made_an/">[comments]</a></span>
