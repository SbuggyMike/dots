<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m very new to emacs and I&#39;m having a hard time understanding it. I&#39;ll eventually learn things, but there&#39;s a couple of pet-peeves I have that I&#39;d appreciate someone to clear up.</p> <p>First, emacs seems to litter my config folder with its own stuff. I want this folder to be backed up in my dotfiles repo, and I don&#39;t want extra stuff in it. Neovim for instance uses the config directory as &quot;read only&quot;. It reads the configuration, and anything that it needs to save (like swap files, plugin data or even the plugins themselves) go into the <code>.local/share/neovim</code> directory. This is neat because it keeps the config tidy. Is there any way to make emacs do that?</p> <p>Second. Emacs vs Doom Emacs. I&#39;ve seen people recommend Doom Emacs a lot. On the neovim world, we also have these distributions that come with a lot of things set up, like AstroVim, NVChad, Spacevim, Lunarvim and others. I&#39;m generally against them, since I prefer to make my own config from scratch so I properly learn and understand my editor, which is the most important part of it all if I want to extend it (and I do).</p> <p>So, I discarded Doom Emacs. But I heard that it&#39;s not just a collection of configs and plugins. The Doom Emacs guys have actually improved emacs and optimized it to make it faster. This is something I would lose of course if I don&#39;t use Doom Emacs, but at the same time I don&#39;t want to have all of their configs, I want to make my own.</p> <p>Are these optimizations planned to be added to stock emacs? Are they good enough to be the main selling point for somebody?</p> <p>Third, about evil mode. I absolutely hate emacs keybindings. Everything is done with control, which is out of the way and it&#39;s really clunky. On the other hand, I absolutely adore vim&#39;s keybindings. Evil mode seems to work wonderfully, but my question is, do I still have to do things the &quot;emacs way&quot; even with evil mode installed? I&#39;ve noticed that some things (like scrolling with C-u) don&#39;t work with evil mode, and emacs takes over in those cases. Is it possible to control emacs in its entirety with only vim keybindings? Since we&#39;re in the topic of scrolling, does emacs support smooth scrolling?</p> <p>And lastly, about it&#39;s &quot;deamon&quot; mode. Is it really necessary to have an emacs deamon running in the background at all times? Is it resource hungry? Why is this needed at all? Is emacs that bloated that it needs to be preloaded to work efficiently? It kinda irks me the wrong way.</p> <p>Other than that (in the meantime) I really do like what I&#39;m seeing. The prospect of being able to do most of my work through emacs is exciting. It&#39;s like an even more extensible neovim, to ridiculous levels even. There&#39;s people using emacs as their window manager, that&#39;s just insane to me.</p> <p>Well, hopefully it&#39;s not too much of a pain for some experienced user to answer these questions. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooPets20"> /u/SnooPets20 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wbpyt8/im_switching_to_emacs_from_neovim/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wbpyt8/im_switching_to_emacs_from_neovim/">[comments]</a></span>
