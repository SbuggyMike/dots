<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to linux but wouldn&#39;t call myself a complete beginner as I know much of the basics like package managers, the unix filesystem, etc. just haven&#39;t really daily driven linux at all. I&#39;m wanting to go with arch but one issue I&#39;m having is the &quot;manual interventions&quot; that you need to do while updating. I have to remote access my computer a lot, sometimes I don&#39;t have physical access for weeks at a time, and I&#39;m curious if anyone knows a best way to keep it updated consistently without risking it bricking while I&#39;m away and can&#39;t fix it. Right now it seems like a damned if you do damned if you don&#39;t situation because if I don&#39;t update it while I&#39;m away then I&#39;ll come back with potentially several bits of manual intervention I need to do which could cause issues with each other and be a nightmare, or I can try to update regularly and get a few cases of manual intervention, that I may not be able to fix and I&#39;ll just be SOL for potentially weeks. </p> <p>I originally considered using an arch derivative like Manjaro but now I&#39;m hearing that Manjaro doesn&#39;t actually keep great compatibility with the AUR and has it&#39;s own issues so I basically have no idea at this point.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/temmiesayshoi"> /u/temmiesayshoi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w00fo8/can_you_remotely_update_safely/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w00fo8/can_you_remotely_update_safely/">[comments]</a></span>
