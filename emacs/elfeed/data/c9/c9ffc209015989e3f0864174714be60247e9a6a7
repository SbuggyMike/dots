A large carbon capture and storage project in Australia fell very short
of its target &mdash; perhaps just half what it was 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/16/gas-giant-chevron-falls-further-behind-on-carbon-capture-targets-for-gorgon-gasfield">supposed to capture.</a>
<p>
This came with a penalty &mdash; Chevron had to buy and use up carbon offsets
to make up for the difference.  As we know, 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/29/chris-bowen-to-announce-review-of-carbon-credits-system-after-expert-labelled-it-a">many of these offsets are
bogus.</a>
<p>
I say the idea of carbon offsets should be replaced with carbon
emission taxes.

Chevron is, of course, culpable for persecuting Steven Donziger for
representing the Ecuadorians whose land was 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/08/chevron-amazon-ecuador-steven-donziger-erin-brockovich">polluted by its oil
extraction there.</a>
