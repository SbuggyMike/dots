<p>I like and use the Brave Browser. It's a <strong>free and open source
browser</strong> with features like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ad-blocking by default.</li>
<li>Tracker-blocking by default.</li>
<li>Anti-fingerprinting mechanisms to prevent you from being monitored.</li>
<li>Built-in Tor windows.</li>
<li>Run by a based Christian and not furry leftists.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, Brave is indisputably the best out-of-the-box general-purpose
browser out there. There are other okay browsers, and I'll mention
things about Brave I don't like, but Brave is especially good because
it comes with all of these sensible features out of the box (you don't
have to go install an ad-blocker), so this makes it very good for
installing it on your grandma's computer. The anti-fingerprinting
abilities are even unique among power-user browsers.</p>
<p>Despite that, there is a loud clique of anti-Brave agitators and Brave
skeptics. Whenever I do a video on Brave, I can expect at least 20%
dislikes and a torrent of comments from people with anime avatars
calling me a &quot;shill&quot; for &ldquo;recommending&rdquo; this browser.</p>
<p>This, I suspect, is because Brave has an optional extra feature: Brave
Rewards, which is &quot;too good to be true.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="brave-rewards">Brave Rewards</h2>
<p>By default, Brave blocks all ads, but users can turn on &quot;Brave
Rewards&quot; to voluntarily view occasional ads and will receive a small
amount of Basic Attention Token (BAT), Brave's cryptocurrency. The ads
don't mess up webpages by appearing in them, but appear in their
computer's notification system.</p>
<p>Brave's entire motivation is to replace traditional ads that fill up
webpages with these kind of ads that share revenue directly with the web
page owners and the people browsing the sites themselves. Ad companies
disappear, the internet debloats and users and actual sites get a direct
cut.</p>
<p>This ad feature is not just <em>optional</em>, but is <em>disabled by default</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that brave has exploded on the scene so quickly make me
suspicious. There's money involved somewhere.&rdquo; &mdash;Comment on a
YouTube video of mine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Because <strong>Brave users literally get money to browse with it.</strong> Duh.</p>
<p>So there is no conspiracy theory about this. <strong>Brave just does
everything right as a browser and they give you free money.</strong> In the
Basic Attention Token system, companies buy ads and the revenue is
shared directly by the owners of sites and the people who view the ads.
This cuts out the middleman ad-companies from the internet. It removes
and disincentivizes bloat in webpages. This is a drastically more
effective and bloatfree way to monetize the internet than old-school
ads. <strong>Or,</strong> you can just keep <em>the default functionality</em> where there
are no ads.</p>
<p>I literally have people post on my videos constantly about how Brave is
a big scheme and &quot;you'll never see a cent of that money.&quot; Meanwhile,
literally every Brave user, including me, gets a monthly payout. You can
even receive your payout directly in US dollars if you want! Even if the
Basic Attention Token framework totally flops, it's not like you're
putting any money into it. The worst that can happen is you saying, &quot;Oh
no, all I have left is the browser with the best out-of-the-box
functionality!&quot;</p>
<p>It reminds me of the joke of two economists walking down the street. One
says, &quot;Hey look, there's a $100 bill on the sidewalk!&quot; The other one
replies, &quot;That's not possible, if there were, someone would've picked
it up already.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The anti-Brave crowd's argument is always some form of &quot;it's too
good to be true.&quot;</strong> In reality, you don't realize how inefficient and
wasteful the previous way of internet ads was. Why pay an ad agency with
employees to pay website developers to put ads into the actual code of
websites, contorting it all into a mess? The BAT system and Brave just
cuts out the middle man and keeps webpages clean by allowing ads to only
be shown when wanted in the user's already existing notification
system. The goal of the BAT project is to universalize Brave and perhaps
similar browsers which block ads and trackers by default, thus cutting
off the very lifeblood of that inefficient and anti-social system.</p>
<p>If you still don't trust the BAT project or think it's gimmicky,
great. <strong>By default, the &quot;Brave Rewards&quot; system is off.</strong> Complaining
about Brave because it has an optional feature to make money is like
complaining about another browser because it has an add-on you don't
plan on using.</p>
<h3 id="tactical-ignorance">Tactical Ignorance</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I use to love brave. NOT anymore.. I'm sure that they are
fingerprinting and using my browsing habits and even search queries
and shows relevant ads. It is not like they are showing some random
pop up for ads. I get ads for NordVPN if I search for best vpn 2020. I
instantly get pop up for lenovo laptops as soon as I search for
laptop. Obviously, with all the utm source and other tracking stuff. I
am making around 15 BAT/month. I don't need those pennies. Back to
Firefox with Ublock Origin and Privacy Badger.&rdquo; &mdash;Comment on a
YouTube video of mine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guy is literally talking as if how Brave works is some kind of
mystery, as if its <em>entire code base</em> isn't openly auditable. No, Brave
doesn't take or &quot;fingerprint&quot; your browsing habits, instead, if you
are enrolled in Brave Rewards, you browser pulls the entire list of adds
from the system, then <em>locally</em> decides on your own computer what ads to
serve.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://brave.com/faq/">Brave's FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Only the browser, after HTTPS terminates and secure pages are
decrypted, has all of your private data needed to analyze user intent.
Our auditable open source browser code protects this intent data on
the client device. Our server side has no access to this data in the
clear, nor does it have decryption keys. We do not run a MitM proxy or
VPN service. We provide signals to the browser to help it make good
decisions about what preferences and intent signals to expose to
maximize user, publisher and advertiser value. Each ad request is
anonymous, and exposes only a small subset of the user&rsquo;s preferences
and intent signals to prevent &ldquo;fingerprinting&rdquo; the user by a possibly
unique set of tags.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="is-brave-bad-for-privacy">Is Brave bad for privacy?</h2>
<p>A popularly linked Neocities site <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/brave.html">Spyware
Watchdog</a> ranks Brave
as having a rank of &quot;High&quot; spyware. The information on the site is
generally good, but a little context-less: if you compare their Brave
article to <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/index.html">their articles on other
browsers</a>, this bad
ranking for Brave is utterly out of place.</p>
<p>Many people who read things and lack basic critical thinking skills
wanted me to either admit or refute this page. Again, the website's
information is good, but there is that same implicitly more skeptical
standard held to Brave than other browsers.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, take the browser Pale Moon. On their site, the
Spyware Watchdog <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/browsers.html">classifies Pale Moon as being &quot;Top Tier&quot; in privacy,
while Brave is &quot;Low
Tier.&quot;</a> But if
you look at <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/palemoon.html">their own
analysis</a>, on
<em>nearly every point</em>, <strong>Brave is superior to Pale Moon</strong>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Issue</th>
<th>Brave&rsquo;s Flaws</th>
<th>Pale Moon&rsquo;s Flaws</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Trackers</td>
<td>Brave blocks ads and trackers, but whitelists Facebook and Twitter to not break cross-site logins for normies. Users can still choose to block these sites in the settings menu.</td>
<td>Pale Moon does not block any ads or trackers at all, so tough luck. Go find an extension that works well with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Forced incompatibility</td>
<td>None.</td>
<td>Pale Moon ships with a blocklist of add-ons that the developers don't want you installing. This includes NoScript and Ad Nauseam.</td>

<tr>
<td>Auto-updates</td>
<td>Brave checks for updates on startup. (I'm not sure if this is the case on Linux too). There is no menu option to disable this but you can block connections to the update site in your hosts file.</td>
<td>Pale Moon automatically checks for updates, add-on updates and changes to the add-on blocklist on start-up. In the <code>about:config</code> some of these can be disabled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Analytics on the Start Page</td>
<td>Brave connects to a free/open source Piwik service to get the number of ads/trackers blocked for the startpage. This can be disabled on the start page.</td>
<td>Pale Moon <strong>connects to Google analytics</strong> on the start page. This can be disabled by changing the start page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Other bad connections</td>
<td>If ads are enabled, Brave makes connection to a site to get ads. It also checks a HTTPS ruleset on an <strong>Amazon server</strong>.</td>
<td>Pale Moon makes a OCSP request for <strong>every website you connect to</strong> to verify their SSL with a third party. This can be turned off in the options.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On pretty much all of these points, when Brave is lacking, Pale Moon is
much worse (that isn't to say that Pale Moon is a bad browser either).
So it doesn't really make sense to me why Brave, which also comes with
additional privacy features like fingerprint-blocking, should be
classified as <em>lower</em> than Pale Meme. That site also claims that Brave
uses the Google search engine as default. If that was ever true, it
isn't now, or at least not on any version of Brave I've used. Brave
asks the user on the first start up which search engine he would like to
use as default. Google is among the choices though.</p>
<p>Note that in their articles they admit that Pale Moon has
&quot;auto-updates,&quot; but complain that Brave has &quot;shitty auto-updates.&quot;
Okay. I wonder what the difference is aside from personal emotion. In
the last paragraph or so, they do mention, if not skirt around all the
<em>actual features</em> of Brave:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;and the fingerprinting protection I don't think is found in any
other browser (but I didn't confirm if it actually works).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does (of course it's an arms-race). But this is an acknowledgment
that Brave is fighting on a level that no other browser is. While other
honorable browsers like Ice Cat are committed to free software, Brave is
also committed to an internet free from ads enmeshed in web pages and
the people who simp for them.</p>
<h2 id="brave-for-normies">Brave for normies</h2>
<p>Aside from nit-picking different browsers, if you want to install a
browser on a computer for a normie relative or friend, <strong>there is no
debate that Brave is the best</strong>. Again, Brave is <em>built</em> with ad and
tracker blocking. Browsers like Pale Moon or Firefox are bad browsers
that <em>can become</em> okay browsers after you manually disable their junk
features and download a bunch of add-ons, but Brave comes as it should
be. Even Brave's token feature of viewing ads to get paid is not on by
default. As it ships, Brave is just a good browser.</p>
<p>This is why I have Brave ship with <a href="https://larbs.xyz">LARBS</a>: it's a
pain to hosts a repository and edit browser settings via dotfiles, while
I can just have Brave installed and that gives a passable, ad-free
experience for users.</p>
<p>So if you want to make a normie's life easier, install Brave. They will
be able to do everything they could do on Chrome, but now they have
decreased their Google liability and no longer have to put up with ads.</p>
<h2 id="grasping-at-straws">Grasping at Straws...</h2>
<h3 id="chromium-based">Chromium based</h3>
<p>When you corner an anti-Brave aggitant, they usually mumble something
about how Brave is bad because it's &quot;Chromium-based.&quot; I've never
seen people use this argument about, say, qutebrowser or other minor
Chromium-based browsers, but I think it's just become &quot;that reason&quot;
for Brave. I honestly, really can't get worked up against a free and
open source software project just because it's been spearheaded by
Google. The ability to fork it always remains if the code goes south or
if it does degenerate stuff.</p>
<p>I think it's especially absurd to place your trust in Mozilla FurryFox
and their team of stereotypical SJWs and soydevs as a functioning
alternative. Remember Mozilla spends its money <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/regrets-reporter/">developing fun add-ons
like
this</a> to
&quot;protect&quot; people emotionally from scary &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and
&quot;alt-right content&quot; on YouTube. I consider Google just as insane and
dangerous, but not necessarily so much <em>more</em> insane so that I for some
reason trust the judgment of Mozilla developers over Google ones.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here's another one from Mozilla FurryFox: <a href="https://archive.is/hzS8G">&quot;We need more
than deplatforming&quot;</a> Moreso than Google,
Mozilla's openly stated goal is an internet totally controlled by
stereotypical dyed-hair SJWs with bad physiognomy.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is, sure, I'd <em>like</em> some browser with an
independent engine. Pale Moon does sort of has that. That's cool. But
that is not enough to make a difference for actual usage. Again, look at
the list of benefits of Brave at the top of this article, all of those
are hard to replicate or find in other browsers. I could go into it
elsewhere, but there are a million little reasons why I don't use Pale
Moon (but you might like it).</p>
<h3 id="affiliate-links">Affiliate links</h3>
<p>Twitter users/Redditors went apoplectic several months ago when they
realized Brave had included affiliate links to some sites whose names
are filled in in the url bar. <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/blog/le-shill-lion">I have already written on
this.</a> It's literally
nothing. As I say there, this is what affiliate links are for. I've
never heard the same crowd through a fit that DuckDuckGo <a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/company/advertising-and-affiliates/">does exactly
the same
thing</a>.
You could even actually see the Brave affiliate links fill in, which is
<em>not</em> the case when clicking on a DuckDuckGo affiliate site link. Still
took these guys months to even notice... This is only something
&quot;controversial&quot; to people who are trying their damnedest to find
something to not like about Brave.</p>
<h2 id="actual-good-complaints-about-brave-and-bat">Actual good complaints about Brave and BAT</h2>
<p>Since most visceral anti-Brave agitators just have a kind of general ax
to grind, I want to take this time to voice my actually annoyances with
Brave and the BAT project. I consider all of these ultimata: I only use
Brave with the expectation that these issues will be fixed in the
future.</p>
<h3 id="get-rid-of-uphold">Get rid of Uphold!</h3>
<p>Actually, let me say that in &lt;h1&gt;...</p>
<h1 id="get-rid-of-uphold-1">Get rid of Uphold!</h1>
<p>So you can get BAT from viewing ads, and people with websites and
YouTube channels can receive donations, great. The annoying thing
however is that you can't just get payouts to a random Ethereum wallet,
instead, you have to use the company <em>Uphold</em>. This is probably
because of legal issues and because I'm sure they have some financial
arrangement, but the BAT project cannot be considered to be a universal
and private solution if users are funneled into some site that requires
a real-world identity.</p>
<p>Legally or technologically difficult to do otherwise? Maybe. But that is
one of the goals of cryptocurrencies anyway and it should be met. Build
the technology so that it's impossible to legally constrain. Most
blockchain technology <em>is already</em> like that.</p>
<p>Users should just be able to give a public Ethereum/Token address and
receive BAT there. That should be it. If you want to offer a
normie-friendly partner service like Uphold, fine, but that should not
be either the default or required. Uphold, I should say, is definitely
not normie-friendly anyway. Since they did a redesign late
September/early Ocotober, I admit I literally cannot figure the site out
and how to transfer my BAT out efficiently.</p>
<p>I should say, in development Brave has had some suboptimal or
non-private features in the past before better solutions were devised. I
mentioned the fact that Brave pulls a non-personalized ad list, but that
wasn't always the case to my understanding: when Brave was starting
out, the browser did request specific ads, giving the central service
some information about user browsing habits. So that at least indicates
that Brave is open to reevaluating methods that are exploitable.</p>
<h3 id="bat-as-a-coin">BAT as a 💩coin</h3>
<p>Let me state it again though, <strong>if the BAT system requires Uphold for
basic functionality, it is not a serious long-term service</strong>. That's
it. I only use and recommend the BAT system under the expectation that
this is a temporary situation that they are actively seeking to remedy.
If anti-Brave shills want to shill about something <em>that actually
matters</em>, <strong>this should be it!</strong></p>
<p>Like most 💩coins, BAT is not decentralized in any meaningful sense. It&rsquo;s KYCed into oblivion and relies on a significant number of platforms in bottleneck positions, including in particular the BAT Project itself. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I even support the BAT Project itself for this reason, I just don&rsquo;t mind using Brave since you can dip your fingers into it without getting KYCed.</p>
<h3 id="auto-updates-and-integrations">Auto-updates and integrations</h3>
<p>I agree strongly with the argument from the Spyware Watchdog site above
that Brave should not make any unsolicited requests to sites, especially
auto-updates, and if it has a reason to, it should have some menu option
to disable it. Any connections a browser makes in the background for
these purposes or for analytics <strong>should be disabled by default</strong> too.</p>
<h3 id="the-browser-should-be-neutral-and-decentralized">The Browser should be neutral and decentralized.</h3>
<p>Somewhat related to the above, if Brave is actually serious about
becoming the commonly used system not just for browsing, but for
internet monetization, it has to be as neutral and decentralized as
possible. Brave has added a lot of optional features for different
services and other little annoyances. Obviously, you can immediately
disable them, but if you want to have a personalizable and universal
browsing experience, Brave should be absolutely blank when you pull it
up on a fresh install.</p>
<h3 id="general-little-features">General little features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ability to not keep track of history but to still keep cookies.
All Chromium browsers lack this menu feature which exists in
Firefox. I'm not sure why this isn't an option because it has
always seemed to me the most sensible way to browse. I don't want
sites I've already seen filling in my url bar!</li>
</ul>
