<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,<br/> I recently accidentally deleted my /etc/ folder and I&#39;m trying to remake it. I&#39;ve got it to where pacman/yay works, my desktop works, etc. However, my fonts do not. At least, in certain places. In polybar, everything <em>but</em> one module uses the default font, and I don&#39;t know why the wifi module doesn&#39;t. They&#39;re all supposed to be using the same font. Google chrome also uses a default font. It&#39;s pretty dang ugly so any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/24thpanda"> /u/24thpanda </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w00gfp/trying_to_fix_arch_using_default_fonts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w00gfp/trying_to_fix_arch_using_default_fonts/">[comments]</a></span>
