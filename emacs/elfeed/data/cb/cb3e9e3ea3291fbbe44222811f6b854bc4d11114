<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On my plasma installation my wifi was working fine and then it just stopped working out of nowhere, I keep getting an error like &quot;wifi network not found&quot; (not always that though) when it tries connecting, my wifi is also working on all of my other devices, such as my phone. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BaseEmotional6824"> /u/BaseEmotional6824 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wgxc2c/wifi_stopped_working_randomly/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wgxc2c/wifi_stopped_working_randomly/">[comments]</a></span>
