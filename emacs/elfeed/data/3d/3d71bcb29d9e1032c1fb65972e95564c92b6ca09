<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My niece (9) is staying at home for a week, she doesn’t listen to symphonic music, not even a genre close to it, she listen to pop and EDM, and her parents doesn’t listen any better.</p> <p>Wondering what would be a good choice to introduce her I’ve picked Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, I was surprised by her receptiveness and willingness to learn and listen more, tonight I’ve played it again, this time on vinyl on my record player, which also added to her experience since was her first time to see a record player.</p> <p>I would like to know what would be the next step, I don’t want to be overwhelming nor boring, I try to keep things simple, but she started to raise some interesting question like how the directors tells the musicians to play; she also recognized the different movements this time and told me Spring’s first movement is her favorite. </p> <p>What shall I play next an why?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Platano-Rex"> /u/Platano-Rex </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wbnspo/getting_a_kid_into_symphonic_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wbnspo/getting_a_kid_into_symphonic_music/">[comments]</a></span>
