<p>&#8216;These three conjoined appeals concern the statutory regime governing the deportation of foreign criminals under section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”). A “foreign criminal” for the purposes of these appeals is a person who is not a British citizen, is convicted in the UK of an offence, and who is sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months. The 2002 Act divides foreign criminals who have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment into two categories. Those sentenced to at least 12 months, but less than four years (“medium offenders”), can avoid deportation if they can establish that its effect on a qualifying child or partner would be “unduly harsh” (“the unduly harsh test”). This is known as Exception 2. Exception 1, which relates to length of lawful residence and integration, is not in issue in this appeal. Those sentenced to at least four years (“serious offenders”) can avoid deportation if they establish that there are “very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2” (“the very compelling circumstances test”). Whether deportation would produce unduly harsh effects for a qualifying partner/child is relevant there too.&#8217;</p>
