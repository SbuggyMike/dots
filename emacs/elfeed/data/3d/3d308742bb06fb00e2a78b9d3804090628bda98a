<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had been running Ubuntu Studio but it lacked stability. I am far from a power user or Linux expert. I use the terminal when necessary. I guess all I mean to share is that Lubuntu is a great option for turning on friends/family to Linux. It all makes sense to me, and I&#39;ve tried all of the main desktops. It rarely crashes and I haven&#39;t had to dpkg /dev/sda1 once yet. :) Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/frenetickticktick"> /u/frenetickticktick </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vzoj53/lubuntu_never_breaks_and_lxqt_is_ideal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vzoj53/lubuntu_never_breaks_and_lxqt_is_ideal/">[comments]</a></span>
