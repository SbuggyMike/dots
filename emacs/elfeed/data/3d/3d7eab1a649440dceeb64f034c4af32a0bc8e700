<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to identify the instruments in this piece, I think it&#39;s from the Baroque period. All I can identify is violins and some type of cymbal?</p> <p>If someone could help me identify the rest that would be great. I&#39;m trying to get better at analysing music. Thanks!</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFIqI_skROI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFIqI_skROI</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wesley316"> /u/wesley316 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8as5i/identifying_instruments/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8as5i/identifying_instruments/">[comments]</a></span>
