<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve saved my wifi network using a wrong profile and I&#39;m unable to edit it. I searched the forums on how to forget the network and they pointed me to /etc/netctl/&lt;network\_name&gt; which somehow doesn&#39;t seem to exist for me ( /etc/netctl has no folder for that network ). How do I forget the network?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ManasLmao_"> /u/ManasLmao_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4jysr/cannot_find_saved_wifi_network_profile/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4jysr/cannot_find_saved_wifi_network_profile/">[comments]</a></span>
