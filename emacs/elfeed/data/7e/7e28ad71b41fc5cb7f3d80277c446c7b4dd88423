<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>For the past.. While. I have been having an issue where my system randomly reboots when I put it under load (gaming). I suspected thermals so I tried using liquidctl with no success, and from the logs where my system has powered up I am getting similar results to the ones described here :<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Ryzen#Troubleshooting">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Ryzen#Troubleshooting</a> (Random reboots)<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/6aj60s/hardware_error_on_cpu_what_to_do/">https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/6aj60s/hardware_error_on_cpu_what_to_do/</a> (exact same case as OP even in the comments with mcelog , just updating didn&#39;t fix it for me).</p> <p>Ive read that it could be a voltage issue but really have no clue, I load a game (Far Cry 4) , it loads the enviornment, then soon after it renders the entire system crashes to a black screen. Im not experienced with overclocking and do not want to mess with voltages.</p> <p>Another to note, this is also only happening with gaming (and Ubisoft games, Payday 2 works fine and Watch Dogs 2 / Far Cry 4 dont).</p> <p>Any ideas ? Please.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JSV007"> /u/JSV007 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wh2gfp/random_reboots_with_mce_events/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wh2gfp/random_reboots_with_mce_events/">[comments]</a></span>
