<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, hope you all are doing well! A few days ago I installed Arch on an HP notebook that I have (I took advantage of the new <code>Archinstall</code> script by the way and the experience was mind blowing!), after the installation process I left the notebook plugged in to my home network through Ethernet to SSH into it from my main system but at the connection time the terminal prompt me with the error message <code>Host key verification failed</code>, I&#39;ve never had this problem before and specially not with a fresh install, I quick solved this problem with the flag <code>StrictHostKeyChecking=no</code> , the connection passed by but every time that I closed and re-opened this SSH connection the password was not required but I didn&#39;t give it a thought at that moment. The next day I SSH the notebook again but this time the password was required and everything works perfectly normal at this point, later that day I wanted to pull a GitHub repo and the terminal prompt <code>Host key verification failed</code> weirdly! I must clarify that my GitHub have been working perfectly before all this episode and also at that error time I cleaned my known_hosts directory but the error has persisted to this day.<br/> I&#39;m a little proficient Linux user by now but I can not understand what is happening with the authentication process and their keys, can someone guide me through this?<br/> Thank you in advance for all your support!
