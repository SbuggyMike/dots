<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, everyone.</p> <p>I have a drawer full of older ARM single board computers, but nothing terribly modern/later than a RasPi4. Can anyone recommend a good, powerful, feature-rich SBC that has a supported Red Hat/Centos/Fedora server distribution for it?</p> <p>For the sake of argument, specs I&#39;m looking for are 8GB+ RAM, 4+ cores, USB3, SATA/NVME/M.2 storage option/2 GB nics.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JayDeeEss"> /u/JayDeeEss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wg8mym/linux_on_arm_sbc_recommendations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wg8mym/linux_on_arm_sbc_recommendations/">[comments]</a></span>
