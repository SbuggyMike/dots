<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have a 2021 Zephyrus G14 and as an attempt to get something better than Windows (even for the sake of a simple UI power management (thanks g helper)) I installed arch. i was about to sleep and i was going to set my laptop to 60hz for work tomorrow but, even though it worked before, the screen went black. i couldn&#39;t do anything. i had to find a way to open konsole (kde plasma) and get the command to change it back to 144. through the settings app, changing it to 60 keeps my display at 144, but the screen is cut in half so i can only see the top half. any help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YT_Flex4249"> /u/YT_Flex4249 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131nwpe/60hz_messes_up_my_screen/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131nwpe/60hz_messes_up_my_screen/">[comments]</a></span>
