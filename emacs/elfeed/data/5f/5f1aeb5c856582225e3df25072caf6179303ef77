<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read that I need to open ports 9295, udp 987, 9296 and 9297 to get Chiaki to work on my steam deck. Can someone tell me the command to do so please? Thank you. Also, I did try searching first and my search seemed to be too general because it wasn&#39;t getting me the right result.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/thestr4ng3r/chiaki/issues/67">https://github.com/thestr4ng3r/chiaki/issues/67</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>This is where I&#39;m coming from</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DextersQuest"> /u/DextersQuest </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w02efh/opening_firewall_ports_for_chiaki_on_steam_deck/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w02efh/opening_firewall_ports_for_chiaki_on_steam_deck/">[comments]</a></span>
