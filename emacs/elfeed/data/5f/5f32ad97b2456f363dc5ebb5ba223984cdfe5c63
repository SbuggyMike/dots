<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don’t know if there’s a word for it, ‘funk’ i guess. I’ve been playing for around 2 years and have got as ‘high’ as 1800 blitz (not great but not too bad) and consider myself a competent enough player. Currently i’m on one of these streaks and while i’m still playing fairly consistently in terms of amount of games, im now down to the high 1500s/low 1600. Losing regularly to players who a few months ago, in theory, i would have beat easily. </p> <p>Wondering is there a cause for this or is this a regular thing in chess? You would think the more games you play, the more you learn/practice the better off you would be and would continue to hover or improve your score, instead, it’s like the more im playing the worse im getting. Losing to a 1590 player a while ago would have been nigh on unthinkable and now it’s almost a given. </p> <p>I play basically all blitz so thats not the best way to learn and only play recreationally so dont do much in terms of real studying apart from watching youtube videos on tactics/openings etc just find it strange how you can play well for months and then all of a sudden regress so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChapoKing"> /u/ChapoKing </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w8t32v/does_anybody_else_go_through_spells_were_they/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w8t32v/does_anybody_else_go_through_spells_were_they/">[comments]</a></span>
