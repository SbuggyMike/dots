Indonesian artists intended to condemn Israel's occupation policies,
but the work they produced appears 
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/documenta-director-resigns-antisemitism-controversy/index.html">very directly antisemitic.</a>

The artists have apologized for that result.

The more figurative and "artistically creative" a work is, while also
making a statement about a controversial issue, the it is likely to to
have various of possible interpretations, perhaps including a very
nasty one.
