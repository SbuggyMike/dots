*UN to investigate prison attack that killed [53]

<p>
The Putin forces claim this was a false flag attack by Ukraine, but
the claim is not plausible.  It is absurd to think that Ukraine would
kill Ukrainians just to have an excuse to accuse the Putin forces of
yet another atrocity.  Ukraine has hundreds, or is it thousands, of
atrocities to charge them with.
<p>
It is the Putin forces that would desire to kill those Ukrainians;
indeed, it had already threatened to execute them.
