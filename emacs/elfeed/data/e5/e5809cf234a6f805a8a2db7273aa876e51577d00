<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a question about splitting my configuration into multiple files, for vanilla Emacs, i.e., no Doom/Spacemacs/etc...</p> <p>I currently have my configuration by split theme which I then load using either <code>(load &quot;my-config.el&quot;)</code> or <code>(require &#39;my-config)</code>. This work well, but it crucially means that it is difficult to compile the configuration files (using the byte compiler or the automatic native compiler). This is because some of these config files have some dependencies on each other. In particular, all my config files assume that the <code>load-path</code> is set correctly and <code>use-package</code> and <code>straight</code> are installed and configured so that packages can be installed or used. When compiling files, especially using the asynchronous native compiler, these files are compiled in batch mode in a vanilla Emacs without any configurations. Hence any statements using unloaded packages would fail.</p> <p>What is the correct way to do this? I know I can put all my config in a single file (literate or otherwise) but I think this will get unwieldy quite quickly for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tohiko"> /u/Tohiko </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb13mo/correct_way_to_split_configuration_into_multiple/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb13mo/correct_way_to_split_configuration_into_multiple/">[comments]</a></span>
