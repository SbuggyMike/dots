<p>Tools like Eclipse's Java Browsing Perspective(https://querix.com/go/beginner/Content/05_workbench/01_ls/02_interface/01_perspectives/java_browsing.htm), Visual Studio's Object Browser make it easier to browse the codebase by components.<p>What are the ways you do it? Is there anything similar available for functional programming?</p>
