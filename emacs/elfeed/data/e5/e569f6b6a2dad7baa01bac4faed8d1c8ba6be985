<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys,</p> <p>I&#39;m very new to Emacs so bear with me..</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using ESS at work to run my R code in Emacs, and it usually works very well (apart from lsp/eglot and flycheck being very slow). However when I run a large amount of R code using <code>polymode-eval-buffer</code> or similar, the code will run, however I will be unable to interact with Emacs the whole time, mousing over Emacs shows the windows loading symbol as my cursor, but doesn&#39;t say &quot;not responding&quot;. The file isn&#39;t particularly long, ~800 lines, and if I run it in two halves using <code>polymode-eval-buffer-from-point-to-end</code> or <code>polymode-eval-buffer-from-beg-to-point</code> it works as expected.</p> <p>The code takes a long time to run, loading in a couple million spatial points and doing stuff with them, which I&#39;m sure is the main reason it happens, but running this code in Rstudio doesn&#39;t freeze it!</p> <p>I&#39;ve read online in various places that setting <code>ess-eval-visibly</code> to <code>nil</code> or <code>nowait</code> solves some peoples issues, but doesn&#39;t change anything for me...</p> <p>Thanks for any help you guys can give!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bepppi"> /u/bepppi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13juqo1/sending_large_whole_r_buffer_to_iess_causes_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13juqo1/sending_large_whole_r_buffer_to_iess_causes_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
