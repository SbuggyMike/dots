<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using a set of bluetooth headphones for the last several months. A2DP has always worked great for listening to music and videos but obviously I needed to switch to HFP in order for the microphone to work. I&#39;m using pulseaudio and was able to enable the HFP profile pretty painlessly with pavcontrol.</p> <p>This was fine until a couple of weeks ago, now my system is showing unavailable in `pactl list`:</p> <pre><code>Profiles: a2dp_sink: High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink) (sinks: 1, sources: 0, priority: 40, available: yes) handsfree_head_unit: Handsfree Head Unit (HFP) (sinks: 1, sources: 1, priority: 30, available: no) off: Off (sinks: 0, sources: 0, priority: 0, available: yes) </code></pre> <p>I followed the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth_headset#HFP_not_working_with_PulseAudio">steps in the wiki</a> relating to HFP issues. But I&#39;m at a bit of a dead end. I tried running:</p> <pre><code>dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.ofono /phonesim org.ofono.Modem.SetProperty string:&quot;Powered&quot; variant:boolean:true </code></pre> <p>With the error</p> <pre><code>Error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownObject: Method &quot;SetProperty&quot; with signature &quot;sv&quot; on interface &quot;org.ofono.Modem&quot; doesn&#39;t exist </code></pre> <p>So I checked to make sure <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Bluetooth/#index1h3">I have activated the modem</a>, but downloading the git repo for ofono and running test/list-modems just creates a draggable text area on my screen for some reason, then exits out.</p> <p>I then went and checked the python code and ran the first couple of lines:</p> <pre><code>import dbus bus = dbus.SystemBus() manager = dbus.Interface(bus.get_object(&#39;org.ofono&#39;, &#39;/&#39;),&#39;org.ofono.Manager&#39;) modems = manager.GetModems() print(modems) &gt;&gt;&gt; dbus.Array([], signature=dbus.Signature(&#39;(oa{sv})&#39;)) </code></pre> <p>So looks like modems is empty and I&#39;m not sure where to go from here?</p> <p>Any help much appreciated.</p> <p>Also curious why the headset is only recently not working, have had no similar issues on my phone.</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jzia93"> /u/jzia93 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w69mij/hfp_audio_is_no_longer_available_stuck_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w69mij/hfp_audio_is_no_longer_available_stuck_on/">[comments]</a></span>
