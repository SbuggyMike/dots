Reading the above post it seems to be fixable on fedora35 through a gnomesetting? Can someone educate me on 1. If this is actually a fix to the blurryness problem of xwayland? 2. If yes: can asimilar thing be achieved for other desktopenvironments?</p> <p>Sorry for long responstimes Europe/Berlin timezone here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tristan_rw"> /u/tristan_rw </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2fi9o/regarding_xwaylands_fractionalscaling/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2fi9o/regarding_xwaylands_fractionalscaling/">[comments]</a></span>
