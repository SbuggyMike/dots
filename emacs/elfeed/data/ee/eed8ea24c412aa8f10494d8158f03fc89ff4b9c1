<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don’t have any eye issues, don’t where glasses or anything, but lots of the time when I play my viola the lines on my sheet music will overlap in my vision (what I imagine dyslexia is like) </p> <p>I was wondering if there is anything I could do that could help fix this (only thing I have in mind could be like reading glasses or something that could make it easier to focus on one line but other than that I have no clue because I have no idea about this and can’t find anything online) </p> <p>I’ll take any information and help anyone has to offer. And if there is a subreddit that is a better place to ask this please let me know, this one just came to mind</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/munchingmelon123"> /u/munchingmelon123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wiuk50/trouble_reading_music_when_playing_viola/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wiuk50/trouble_reading_music_when_playing_viola/">[comments]</a></span>
