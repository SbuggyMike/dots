<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am tinkering with EXWM again and I would like to be able to access to the keybinding space activated by the &#39;general prefix key&#39;. I use Evil package and the prefix key is SPC when in normal mode. The problem is that this prefix is not available in Firefox and such because SPC gets intercepted.</p> <p>So, my question is, how do I add C-SPC as an additional prefix key so that both SPC and C-SPC act as viable ways to activate the which-key minibuffer? I would use SPC in Emacs buffers and C-SPC in xorg clients.</p> <p>Side question, related to EXWM: Does anybody know why the media keys do not work in full screen videos played in firefox? If the video is not in fullscreen the media keys work, which is really weird. First time I see something like this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kamui78"> /u/kamui78 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/131hbtr/general_package_configuration_additional_prefix/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/131hbtr/general_package_configuration_additional_prefix/">[comments]</a></span>
