<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been studying more open theory lately and some issues about my approach came up.</p> <p>If the book or course you&#39;re studying recommends a specific line, do you always follow it to a T? Do you check with an engine to guarantee the move is sound? Are there lines that even if they get recommended, you try to avoid? Or do you try as possible to learn them even if you&#39;re very bored and/or uncomfortable?</p> <p>Do you usually write full lines of the core variations (say, 12-15 moves tops) and then note down general ideas, or is it best to have complete variations up to 25+ moves down to an example endgame, with notes on where the opponent might go wrong?</p> <p>Are there tenets or regimes you use to rule your study by, and to make it more productive?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/doctor_awful"> /u/doctor_awful </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wgj439/approach_to_learning_opening_theory/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wgj439/approach_to_learning_opening_theory/">[comments]</a></span>
