On the series tying victory: &quot;I can finally breathe now. It has been a tough summer, we have lost a couple of close games. Happy to cross the line. Bowlers were fantastic. Obed, McCoy. They used the pitch, the conditions, the wind well. The batters got us off to a good start, and even though we stumbled, a win is a win in the end. I believe that in T20 cricket our better batters have to bat more. It didn&#39;t work out for myself and Hetmyer today, but we want to continue taking responsibility. King batted really well, thought he should win the game for us, but he will learn from this. Thomas returned from an injury and came trumps in his home ground. McCoy is a bit of a freak, and we need to deal with him, but today he was excellent. Was smart bowling to Dinesh Karthik, lovely to have him in the team. Good to have the left-arm option as well.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Losing captain Rohit Sharma</strong> is here. His assessment: &quot;It was not enough runs on the board for us. We didn&#39;t bat well. Pitch was playing quite nicely but we didn&#39;t apply ourselves. But that can happen. I have said again and again that when you are trying something as a batting group, it won&#39;t work out always. We will try to see our mistakes and look to correct them. (20th over from Avesh) It&#39;s all about giving opportunity. We know Bhuvneshwar, what he brings to the table, but if you don&#39;t give opportunity to Avesh or Arshdeep you will never find out what it means to bowl at the death for India. They have done it in the IPL. Just one game, those guys don&#39;t need to panic. They need backing and opportunity. (Fighting effort) Proud of the team. When you are defending a target like that, it can end in 13-14 overs or you try to drag it to the last over. Guys kept fighting, it was important to take wickets. The planning we did, the guys came and executed. Happy with bowlers, but there are certain things in the batting we need to look at. I will again and again say that we will continue to bat in this fashion because we want to achieve something. One-off result, shouldn&#39;t panic. After one loss we won&#39;t change things around.&quot;</p> <p><strong>McCoy is the POTM</strong> and this is what he has to say. &quot;I want to thank God,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#39;m doing this for my mom, she is home sick. This is motivating me to be a better player. Thankful for it. (Rohit wicket) It put a lot of pressure on their batters. I always look for wickets in the powerplay because that stops batsmen from scoring runs in the powerplay. (Reason for success) Went in with a clear mind. Was overthinking in the previous game. (His role - powerplay and back end) It gives me a lot of challenge and experience. Helps groom me as a player.&quot;</p> <p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=poochi&amp;subject=Bot%20Feedback"><sup>Send feedback</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_schedule"><sup>Schedule</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_help"><sup>Stat Help</sup></a></p> <p><sup>Please don&#39;t post illegal streaming links in match threads</sup></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CricketMatchBot"> /u/CricketMatchBot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wdsc8t/post_match_thread_india_vs_west_indies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wdsc8t/post_match_thread_india_vs_west_indies/">[comments]</a></span>
