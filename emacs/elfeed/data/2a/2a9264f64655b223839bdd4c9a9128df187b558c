We&#39;ve already seen the Online Safety Bill delayed until autumn. Could other pieces of legislation go the same way?</p> <p><strong>That said, it&#39;s the last week before recess.</strong></p> <p>So just another few days of lawmaking before MPs head back to their constituencies for the summer. When they come back on 5 September we&#39;ll have a successor to Boris Johnson.</p> <p><strong>And an unusual move from the PM on Monday.</strong></p> <p>He&#39;s scheduled a motion of confidence in his own government. Labour tried to move a similar motion last week, which was rejected because it was worded as a confidence vote in the government <em>and</em> the prime minister.

Ten minute rule motion presented by Kevin Hollinrake.</p> <p><strong>Northern Ireland Protocol Bill - committee stage</strong><br/> <em>Applies to: England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland</em><br/> Gives the government the power to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which lays out the post-Brexit trading agreements for Northern Ireland. At the moment, there&#39;s effectively a hard border in the Irish Sea, which means checks on certain goods moving between Britain and Northern Ireland. The government wants to make it easier for those goods to flow, but the EU argues that going back on the Northern Ireland Protocol is against international law.<br/> <a href="https://clearthelobby.co.uk/s/w/UOcEIJc20OyZ892vg2IZxtgw"><strong>Draft bill</strong></a><a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-03/0012/220012.pdf"> <strong>(PDF)</strong></a> <strong>/</strong> <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9548/"><strong>Commons Library briefing</strong></a></p> <h3>WEDNESDAY 20 JULY</h3> <p><strong>Pensions (Extension of Automatic Enrolment) Bill</strong><br/> Extends automatic pension enrolment to all workers aged 18 or over, regardless of how much they earn.
