<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After using arch for about 2 years and never encountered any problem, today I did a sudo pacman -syyu and now my computer wonâ€™t boot up anymore (as described in title). I tried ctrl + alt + f2 and the login screen shows up for like a second and disappears. Any help would be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yessirnah"> /u/yessirnah </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1392pm6/black_screen_and_blinking_cursor_on_boot_after/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1392pm6/black_screen_and_blinking_cursor_on_boot_after/">[comments]</a></span>
