<p>Another day, another Álvaro Ramírez post. It’s hard to keep up. His latest post is macOS specific but very useful for those using a Mac who want to take a screen shot or capture a video. The Mac, of course, has a built-in way of doing this but it’s one of those obscure things that you probably don’t know about unless you’ve made a specific effort to research how to do it.</p>
<p>You can check Ramírez’a post to see how to do it but it’s as simple as invoking a key sequence. Taking a screen shot, Ramírez says, works well but he’s less happy with making a screen video. The problem is you can’t specify a window directly. You have to use a region and that may lead to including some background or wallpaper in the video.</p>
<p>That’s a little annoying but Ramírez, of course, can’t let it stand. His post, <a href="https://xenodium.com/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/">Recording and screenshotting windows: the lazy way</a>, explains his solution to all this. The TL;DR is that he wrote a utility to help with capturing screenshots and videos and then integrated it into Emacs with his <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command">dwim-shell-command</a> package. It’s a nice solution.</p>
<p>If you’re a Mac user and especially if you’re in the intersection of Mac and Emacs users, you may find his post useful. Ramírez’s solution provides a very easy way to capture screenshots and videos for blogs or reports. Definitely worth a look.</p>
