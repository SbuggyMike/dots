<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use <code>tab-bar-mode</code> a lot. I also have a lot of stuff on my mode-line. I used to use Emacs such that I could see the clock on my OS, but now I want to try using Emacs entirely full-screen; problem is, I don&#39;t have a clock any more. I used to have it on the mode-line, but I didn&#39;t like how the time was replicated <em>everywhere</em>, and it was taking up space that I wanted for other things.</p> <p>Is there a way to put a clock, say, in the right side of the tab-bar? This is a little line of space that is almost <em>never</em> in use, so it&#39;d be perfect.</p> <p><strong>Update</strong>: Here&#39;s a hack that I <em>don&#39;t</em> recommend, but it was kinda fun to figure out: it uses a posframe and a timer to get it to display: <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/%7Eashton314/4d490af6b4c6ae2f00012c8d807383001b242f1e">https://paste.sr.ht/~ashton314/4d490af6b4c6ae2f00012c8d807383001b242f1e</a></p> <p>There are some better suggestions in the comments, which I&#39;ll probably be using. :)</p> <p><strong>2nd Update</strong>: Thanks to <a href="/u/karthink">u/karthink</a>, I&#39;ve found a solution that works perfectly:</p> <p><code>lisp (add-to-list &#39;tab-bar-format &#39;tab-bar-format-align-right &#39;append) (add-to-list &#39;tab-bar-format &#39;tab-bar-format-global &#39;append) (setq display-time-format &quot;%a %e %b %T&quot;) (setq display-time-interval 1) (display-time-mode) </code></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/varsderk"> /u/varsderk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3p8op/clock_in_tab_bar/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3p8op/clock_in_tab_bar/">[comments]</a></span>
