<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone. </p> <p>I&#39;ve recently decided to step away from chess to work on my mental health. I&#39;ve been improving pretty consistently and have been playing online and OTB since last summer, but there&#39;s been such a sharp downturn as of late. Over the past few weeks, I&#39;ve noticed myself gradually descending into some pretty rough habits while playing (a truly awful/hateful internal dialogue, frequent self-injurious behaviors, self-sabotaging rated games via fool&#39;s mate and such, etc.), and I want to close my chessdotcom account every time I log in. There are some other life stressors that are certainly fueling this funk, but it&#39;s ironic because I initially got into chess last year as a way to improve my mental health. I&#39;m a bit sad because I initially derived so much joy from and dug so intensely into playing and learning. Perhaps I burned a bit too bright too quickly.</p> <p>I&#39;m not asking for medical advice, and I&#39;m well connected to my therapist and other resources, but I wanted to ask whether anyone else has gone through something similar and how, if and when you were ready, you reapproached chess in a healthier way? I fundamentally love and cherish the game, but it&#39;s hard to feel that way right now. Thanks in advance :)</p> <p>For those who may need it: US Suicide hotline: 988; SAMHSA: 1-800-662-HELP; <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org">Trevor project</a>; please share other resources (international, etc.) as needed!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Whr_ghv"> /u/Whr_ghv </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132lt0v/chess_and_mental_health/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132lt0v/chess_and_mental_health/">[comments]</a></span>
