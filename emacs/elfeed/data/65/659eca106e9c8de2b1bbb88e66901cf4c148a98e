Took an amazing diving catch, introduced the sport to friends and many interested passerbys (and lifeguards), and just simply had one of the best times of my life losing by a shit ton. Beach cricket is the way - anything goes, happiness achieved.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/schitzengigul"> /u/schitzengigul </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/3nm9e9ej6ge91.jpg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wawtuw/simply_beach_cricket/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
