<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Peeps,</p> <p>Earlier this year i made a post testing the water to gauge the interest for a Linux based cloud gaming service and streaming client ! Here is the Original Post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/stzb63/would_you_be_interested_in_a_linux_based_cloud/">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/stzb63/would_you_be_interested_in_a_linux_based_cloud/</a></p> <p>The reaction was mixed to be honest but we decided to go ahead with the proposal and make the offering mentioned above a reality. We are proud to announce that we have developed a Linux Mint Based cloud gaming service and built upon existing streaming solutions to cater more specifically to our needs.</p> <p>Our cloud gaming service is now based of Linux Mint 20.03 with AMD next gen hardware and kernel level driver support streaming via our Open source Host client &#39;The Maxximizer&#39; (<a href="https://github.com/Sean-MaximumSettings/Maxximizer-Sunshine-Complete">https://github.com/Sean-MaximumSettings/Maxximizer-Sunshine-Complete</a>) onto Moonlights client based streaming software (<a href="https://github.com/moonlight-stream">https://github.com/moonlight-stream</a>).</p> <p>The systems we offer have all the necessary software to make sure clients can have the most seamless experience from booting up their gaming instance to installing and playing their favorite games from the launcher of their choice. This is possible through the use of Proton GE/Lutris and wine. We hope to see our service grow along with the Linux Gaming Community as a whole, and are excited to see the possibilities.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Id like to leave some videos below to show our service in action !</p> <p>Maximum Settings Cloud Linux Machine Set Up Instructions:</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBWfCqI26jc&amp;t=6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBWfCqI26jc&amp;t=6s</a></p> <p>How to play games with Lutris With Maximum Settings</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHatqFCLY2Q&amp;t=13s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHatqFCLY2Q&amp;t=13s</a></p> <p>Cyberpunk, God of War, The Witcher Wild Hunt, Star Wars, Immortals on Maximum Settings Linux – 1440p (2560 x 1440)</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FM5zvlNYUU&amp;t=269s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FM5zvlNYUU&amp;t=269s</a></p> <p>The Quarry PC – AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT at 1440p (2560 x 1440p) – Linux Mint 20.03 OS</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVKm-Pc9PI&amp;t=225s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVKm-Pc9PI&amp;t=225s</a></p> <p>Death Stranding - AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT at 1440p (2560 x 1440p) – Linux Mint 20.03 OS<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwv_q643o7I&amp;t=218s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwv_q643o7I&amp;t=218s</a></p> <p>External Reviews:</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUHcTShg14k&amp;t=144s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUHcTShg14k&amp;t=144s</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Please feel free to ask any questions about our offering/service or our host based open source streaming software.
