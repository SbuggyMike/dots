<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have very basic knowledge of classical composers and their works (Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Ligeti, Chopin, Debussy), but I&#39;ve been racking my head for the past few weeks listening to endless symphonies and works from some of the most obscure (to my mind) composers that evoke the same sounds as the following two pieces:</p> <ol> <li>Wojciech Kilar - Opening Titles (The Ninth Gate OST)</li> </ol> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7APF2mUo7bE&amp;ab_channel=MichelSoundtrackMovies">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7APF2mUo7bE&amp;ab_channel=MichelSoundtrackMovies</a></p> <ol> <li>Alan Hovhaness - Mysterious Mountain (specifically the 1st and 4th movement; Andante &amp; Andante Espressivo)</li> </ol> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQZBrJmzsrc&amp;ab_channel=soyink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQZBrJmzsrc&amp;ab_channel=soyink</a></p> <p>Any help at all (the more specific the better) would truly be appreciated, as I&#39;m not sure what my next course of action would be (already attempting the &#39;six degrees&#39; version of branching off from both composers, and I&#39;m still religiously going through all their works) other than to pinpoint specific classical movements.</p> <p>Thanks either way!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/magisterloodi"> /u/magisterloodi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wbqvbf/help_looking_for_composers_or_specific/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wbqvbf/help_looking_for_composers_or_specific/">[comments]</a></span>
