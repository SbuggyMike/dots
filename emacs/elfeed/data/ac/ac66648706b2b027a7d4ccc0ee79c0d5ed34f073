<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, Ive been using ivy for a while now, and its been blooming smooth sailing. One thing i havent figured out though is how to prioritize specific completions; my search-fu is failing me here. What i want is to be able to provide a list of interactive functions (I only need this for executing extended commands) that, should they be in the list of completions, should be placed first in the completion list. For example, currently if i type in <code>sly connect</code>, the function <code>sly-connect</code> isnt first, that honor goes to <code>sly-list-connections</code>. As there â €isnt any way to narrow down completion to <em>just</em> <code>sly-connect</code> without replacing the space with a hyphen, i have to add it to the list of functions i have to type literally. So, is there any way to prioritize certain completions? Or, do you have other recommendations for how to solve this issue without needing to remember specific functions? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The9thHuman"> /u/The9thHuman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whlloq/prioritize_certain_completions_in_ivy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whlloq/prioritize_certain_completions_in_ivy/">[comments]</a></span>
