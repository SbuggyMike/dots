<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I was having trouble with my qtile config, made some errors and got booted back to the tty... For ducks sake not again! I slowly began muttering to myself, until I realized there was no need for the bloat that is a window manager.</p> <p>startx /usr/bin/emacs -geometry 223x58-0-0</p> <p>This command is a gift from the gods, all you could ever want. Set as an alias to &#39;emacs-tty&#39;!</p> <p>The only downfall is the fonts... Not really sure what fonts can be used, and emojis aren&#39;t working. If anyone knows how to solve this that would be great.</p> <p>Other than that, stop torturing yourself with a non-graphical emacs!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tapatahi"> /u/tapatahi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wg9lah/emacs_gui_from_a_tty/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wg9lah/emacs_gui_from_a_tty/">[comments]</a></span>
