<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to install Arch on an old Acer laptop (specifically an Aspire v3-772g). I&#39;m running into problems when trying to install GRUB. I have my EFI system partition mounted at /boot and I have confirmed I am booting in UEFI mode. When installing GRUB I run the following command</p> <pre><code>grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB </code></pre> <p>which gives the following output</p> <pre><code>Installing for x86_64-efi platform. Skipping unreadable variable &quot;Boot2000&quot;: Interrupted system call Skipping unreadable variable &quot;Boot2001&quot;: Interrupted system call Skipping unreadable variable &quot;Boot2002&quot;: Interrupted system call Skipping unreadable variable &quot;Boot2003&quot;: Interrupted system call Could not prepare Boot variable: Interrupted system call grub-install: error: efibootmgr failed to register the boot entry: Input/Output error </code></pre> <p>If I run grub-install with the --no-nvram and/or --removable flags, it appears to install correctly. I can then run grub-mkconfig as usual which, again, does not output any errors. However, after removing the installation USB, the --no-nvram flag results in no bootable system, while the --removable flag results in a GRUB rescue shell upon boot.</p> <p>I have tried installing rEFInd and gotten similar sorts of errors, so I do not believe it is a GRUB-specific issue. In my searches online, I&#39;ve seen some people ask for the output of </p> <pre><code>efibootmgr -v </code></pre> <p>and so I figure I will post its output as well</p> <pre><code>Skipping unreadable variable &quot;Boot2001&quot;: Interrupted system call error trace: efivarfs.c:275 efivarfs_get_variable(): read failed: Interrupted system call lib.c:140 efi_getvariable(): ops-&gt;get_variable failed: Interrupted system call Skipping unreadable variable &quot;Boot2002&quot;: Interrupted system call error trace: efivarfs.c:275 efivarfs_get_variable(): read failed: Interrupted system call lib.c:140 efi_getvariable(): ops-&gt;get_variable failed: Interrupted system call Skipping unreadable variable &quot;Boot2003&quot;: Interrupted system call error trace: efivarfs.c:275 efivarfs_get_variable(): read failed: Interrupted system call lib.c:140 efi_getvariable(): ops-&gt;get_variable failed: Interrupted system call No BootOrder is set; firmware will attempt recovery </code></pre> <p>Any ideas on what the issue is? When I booted up this laptop it was running Elementary OS that I setup months and months ago. It was running in BIOS mode rather than UEFI mode, so maybe there was some error at the time that I corrected by switching modes?</p> <p>At any rate, thank you in advance for any suggestions. Let me know if there is any other info you need.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/araxxorisbest"> /u/araxxorisbest </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzfhor/errors_with_grubefibootmgr/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzfhor/errors_with_grubefibootmgr/">[comments]</a></span>
