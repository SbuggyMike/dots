<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ever since I started to use Arch, 50% of my terminal installs have looked like this:</p> <p>-I type in &quot;sudo pacman -S [whatever package I need]&quot;</p> <p>-I get asked if I should &quot;Import PGP key [name] [email]?&quot;, I say yes</p> <p>-I get an error of this structure:</p> <p><strong>error:</strong> lib32-glib-networking: signature from &quot;[name] &lt;email&gt;&quot; is unknown trust<br/> <strong>:: File /var/cache/pacman/pkg/lib32-glib-networking-2.70.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).</strong><br/> <strong>Do you want to delete it?

I have never gotten an error like this in other linux distros. I have tried to search it up on ArchWiki, but as a newbie to all things programming-related, I have absolutely no idea what they&#39;re talking about.</p> <p>Can anyone please explain to me what a keyring is, why it&#39;s needed for installing packages and how to fix these errors?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alekdmcfly"> /u/alekdmcfly </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w846y0/i_keep_having_keyring_errors_and_i_have/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w846y0/i_keep_having_keyring_errors_and_i_have/">[comments]</a></span>
