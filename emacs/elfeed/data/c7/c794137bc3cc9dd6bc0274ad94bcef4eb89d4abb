  Thugs in Akron <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/04/jayland-walker-shooting-body-cam-video-outrage">shot and killed a black man who was running away from
  them</a>.

  He may have been a criminal &mdash; he had left a loaded gun behind in the
  car, and was reportedly wearing a ski mask (in June!).  But he was not
  threatening anyone when they killed him.  Perhaps he deserved to be
  tried and convicted &mdash; we don't know &mdash; but there were no grounds for
  killing him.

  The article linked to just above displays symbolic bigotry by
  capitalizing "black" but not "white".  (To avoid endorsing bigotry,
  capitalize both words or neither one.)  I object to bigotry, and
  normally I will not link to articles that promote it.  But I make
  exceptions for some articles that I consider particularly important.
  That article is one of the exceptions.
