<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since I first installed Arch about ~4 months ago, it would sometimes need a restart of NetworkManager before being able to connect to the internet. I&#39;d put it around maybe every other time I boot, maybe a little less. I dual boot so I reboot quite often, and it doesn&#39;t seem to matter if I&#39;ve rebooted from windows into arch, just rebooted arch, or first turned on my computer from full power off. I am connected via ethernet, so there are no wireless settings configured anywhere, either.</p> <p>Tried fixing it a few times by checking out the wiki but never found a solution, and wasn&#39;t bothered enough to ask around anywhere. If I need to post any other info let me know!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The_TJeep"> /u/The_TJeep </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wgn4bb/network_manager_sometimes_requires_a_restart/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wgn4bb/network_manager_sometimes_requires_a_restart/">[comments]</a></span>
