This is a request for a small technical project for someone who knows
Javascript.
<p>
Boston public transit has changed its web site, mbta.com, so that it
is impossible to access bus schedules without running nonfree
software.  It used to have a "PDF Schedule" button with which you
could download a bus line's schedule.  But that no longer works.
<p>
For instance, the page for bus line 1, mbta.com/schedules/1/line, has
a button "Get schedules", but without enabling Javascript that gives
an error.
<p>
Can someone please develop a script or method to access these PDF
files?  It could be a simple shell script that uses wget, grep and awk,
or simple Javascript program if you can tell me how to run it.
Please give it clear comments so I can understand what it does,
and if it is more than 8 lines or so put a free license on it.
<p>
I will appreciate your work every time I look at a bus schedule.
