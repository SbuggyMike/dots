<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you genuinely want to support, Mozilla Firefox, use the stock install and allow Firefox to report data automatically.</p> <ol> <li>Many distros bundle Firefox but customize it. As a result, someone often is wasting their time, trying to figure out if an issue is with Firefox or the customization the distro added. It ends up being a lot of unnecessary wasted time that could be spent trying to improve the product (Firefox).</li> <li>The more people who participate either directly or indirectly, the more knowledge Mozilla will have to improve their browser. It is why often chromium has an advantage because you cannot opt-out, and so they know how everyone uses their browser and how to make that experience better. It&#39;s nice that you can opt-out in Mozilla, but you&#39;re not doing anyone any favors when you do.</li> </ol> <p>You can easily download a fresh, copy of Mozilla Firefox, directly from their website. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/browsers/">https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/browsers/</a> </p> <p>Ultimately, the more people who use a clean copy of Mozilla Firefox, and participate in the basic analytics, the better the browser can be. This is the best passive way, you can help Mozilla Firefox.</p> <p>Additionally, if you wish to take a more active role, you can also directly submit bugs and provide direct feedback. Information on this can be located here <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla</a></p> <p>I made a simple installer, so even newbies could install a clean, stock experience directly from Mozilla (along with all the shortcuts). It works independently, so it has no impact on the packages you have installed. You can install any edition of Mozilla Firefox, side by side, if you wish, including your distro&#39;s bundled copy. Lastly, if you don&#39;t want it installed for everyone, or are not the system admin, I also have a personal, localized installer too (keeps everything in your home folder). <a href="https://github.com/Linux-Is-Best/Firefox-automatic-install-for-Linux">https://github.com/Linux-Is-Best/Firefox-automatic-install-for-Linux</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Linux-Is-Best"> /u/Linux-Is-Best </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wc86tg/how_you_as_a_linux_user_can_help_mozilla_firefox/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wc86tg/how_you_as_a_linux_user_can_help_mozilla_firefox/">[comments]</a></span>
