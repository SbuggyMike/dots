<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I do not know if it makes sense. But I am not a programmer. I just write academic articles using markdown and latex. I tried different editors and really liked emacs. I just copied a few people&#39;s setup files for my emacs, and I&#39;ve already lost track of those pieces. </p> <p>I would like to learn some basics in LISP so that I can not only understand some of those setups but also be able to create some quick modifications of my own. </p> <p>Is this going to be a waste of time? Is there a quick guide for someone who has almost zero knowledge of programming? (A computer scientist told me LISP was actually hard to use nowadays, so I should not spend time on this. I should just keep using others&#39; setups for my own purpose.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/beerbearbare"> /u/beerbearbare </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1310meu/quickly_learning_some_lisp_basics_for_using_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1310meu/quickly_learning_some_lisp_basics_for_using_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
