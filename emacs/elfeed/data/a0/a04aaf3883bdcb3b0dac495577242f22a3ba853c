Christiania, the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/gang-violence-could-end-open-cannabis-trade-in-anarchist-commune-christiania">anarchist town in the middle of Copenhagen</a>,
has
allowed sale of marijuana by known local people for 50 years.  Now
criminal gangs have moved in, taken control, and are fighting over
the "territory".  It looks like they have ruined everything.

I think the existence of these powerul gangs is a consequence of
prohibition in the rest of the country and the world.  Prohibition of
marijuana (or any drug) does not get rid of it, but helps the gangs
make lots of money.
