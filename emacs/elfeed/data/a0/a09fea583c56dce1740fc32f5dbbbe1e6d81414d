<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I have been using nvidia-open for a while, and I am really surprised how well it works. I was expecting it to have issues, but for my 3080 it seems to be running a few games even better. Close to the sun was rather stuttery initially, but after switching to open module, it&#39;s been running super well.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t tested wayland but some hyprland users seem to say it is working with nvidia-open.</p> <p>What has your experience been? Are you using it? Any improvements you noticed?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Drostina"> /u/Drostina </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vvp9ha/what_has_your_experience_with_nvidiaopen_been/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vvp9ha/what_has_your_experience_with_nvidiaopen_been/">[comments]</a></span>
