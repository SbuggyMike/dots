<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Did Bach have any pieces that were his favorites among his works? What about of other composers?</p> <p>I remember reading something about Haydn&#39;s acclamation of Mozart&#39;s six &quot;Haydn&quot; string quartets, which after hearing them he wrote that Mozart was the greatest composer he knew. Mozart also wrote that those particular quartets were &quot;the fruit of a long and laborious endeavor.&quot; At its time, Chopin wrote that his first ballade was his dearest work, and Schumann wrote that it was his favorite of Chopin&#39;s works.</p> <p>I wonder if Bach was known to have put a lot of effort into something in particular or had a piece/set of pieces which were favored by other composers, and if he highly praised any specific works by other composers as well.</p> <p>And though his music isn&#39;t inherently emotional, I wonder if he did write pieces with emotional charge/affect in mind. A lot of you might know of the story of how scholars speculate Bach wrote the Chaconne of BWV 1004 after learning that his first wife passed away while he was on a trip, thus why people interpret that the piece is grief-stricken and tragic.</p> <p>On one hand I can see why, seeing as it&#39;s unusual for there to be a massive final movement the duration of the first 4 combined, as opposed to the customary gigue or occasional quick dance like the BWV 831 Echo or the BWV 1067 Badinerie. On the other hand, it could have just been a really inspired compositional product with little to no emotionally-tied prompt whatsoever, which I think is more likely: <em>“There is no evidence that Bach himself considered the chaconne to encode an entire vista of the universe or to sound out his own emotional depths. Such Romantic notions would never have occurred to a court composer who had trained in the late 1600s as a Lutheran town organist. Creating art then and there was not an act of personal expression but one of civic or religious service. Of course emotions could be depicted and messages delivered. But musicians of Bach’s generation did not need to feel an emotion in order to depict it. It was the next generation, beginning with Bach’s own son Carl Philipp Emanuel, who began to demand that a musician express emotions in a way we would call ‘authentic’.” (Michael Markham)</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/choerry_bomb"> /u/choerry_bomb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/weu96h/did_bach_favor_any_of_his_particular_compositions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/weu96h/did_bach_favor_any_of_his_particular_compositions/">[comments]</a></span>
