<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A while ago i watched a video of Brodie Robertson, talking about init systems.</p> <p>And he talked about making the bash shell the init system of the kernel in case of emergency, being unable to boot into to kernel.</p> <p>Today i fucked up a module config, long story short: my graphic module was disabled, so i couldn’t boot into a tty, as i was stuck into systemd.</p> <p>So i temporarily set init=/bin/bash as my init system, to boot as root. That way i had a basic tty in root mode, so i solved my issue and rebooted normally.</p> <p>So keep in mind guys: if you fuck up a config, instead of immediately consider your install as Nuked, try giving init=/bin/bash a shot. </p> <p>I wish y’all a great day.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spidfight"> /u/Spidfight </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcnvb2/initbinbash_just_saved_my_arch_install/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wcnvb2/initbinbash_just_saved_my_arch_install/">[comments]</a></span>
