I like 
<a href="https://nitter.snopyta.org/AOC/status/1540755940542119938">what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted,</a>
<p>
but it may have a correctable problem.  It appears that "codifying
Roe" may 
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/opinions/codifying-roe-scotus-abortion-nourse/index.html">be difficult or impossible to do</a>
<p>
in a way that the Supreme
Court extremists can't wreck; but expanding the court to restore Roe
can work, if we don't wait too long.
