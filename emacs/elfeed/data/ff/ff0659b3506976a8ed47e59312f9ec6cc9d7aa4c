<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2EupTDpWhQ">this performance of an aria</a> (Un&#39;aura amorosa) from Mozart&#39;s Cosi fan Tutte... and let me just take a second- </p> <p>As some may know, the plot of this opera is a shit-show. Yet in this scene, with just a few words and a few minutes, Mozart conjures a lush oasis of contemplation, respite, and warmth in the middle of the madness. An eye of the storm where we float above the vortex of silly insults, guilt, jealousy... and bask in restorative meditation of tranquil, naive yearning... but not just naive. Mozart takes a character who we should be laughing at, and instills him with such dignity and wisdom that we question the very fabric of every interaction of the story thus far.</p> <p>No matter how funny or ridiculous a situation gets, Mozart hides a serenity that makes it significant. No matter how beautiful or time-stopping a moment is, Mozart throws in a humorous quip to remind us not to take it too seriously. His ultimate gift was a vast understanding, forgiveness and love for the flawed and ambiguous thing we call the human mind. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I&#39;ve watched this opera many times. This aria hardly gets mentioned in regular conversation and I didn&#39;t really connect to it until now. But am I surprised? You can hardly take a single step through this act without tripping on a crack of genius... and I am on a fruitless mission to trip on them all, one crack at a time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/samehada121"> /u/samehada121 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/133a1pk/excuse_me_sirmaam_do_you_have_a_moment_to_talk/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/133a1pk/excuse_me_sirmaam_do_you_have_a_moment_to_talk/">[comments]</a></span>
