<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/linux">/r/linux</a>! I&#39;ve just released the 0.2.0 version of my application <a href="https://github.com/dweymouth/supersonic">Supersonic</a>, a lightweight desktop client for Subsonic music servers. Written in Go with the Fyne UI library, it features a snappy clean UI (with no Javascript!) and high-quality gapless audio playback using libmpv. I&#39;ve announced past releases on r /selfhosted but I figured it&#39;s time to announce here as well, especially since music players was such a popular mention on the post the other day about what kinds of apps are missing from the Linux ecosystem!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dweymouth"> /u/dweymouth </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/138t8j6/supersonic_020_released_desktop_music_player_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/138t8j6/supersonic_020_released_desktop_music_player_for/">[comments]</a></span>
