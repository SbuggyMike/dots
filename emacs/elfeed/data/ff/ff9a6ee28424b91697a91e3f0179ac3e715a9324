<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using Arch Linux on my Steam Deck, since i want things like native packages and AUR, disk partitions control, etc.</p> <p>The other day a &quot;Speakers&quot; entry appeared on the kde audio plasmoid on the taskbar, probably because of some package update, but it still doesn&#39;t actually output anything. Any help with this?</p> <p>I tried searching on steamos for clues but I didn&#39;t really find anything of worth.</p> <p>I&#39;m using the neptune kernel (the one used in steamos) and some other packages from valve&#39;s repo (nothing that i know it&#39;s important for audio except for jupiter-hw-support).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kevadro"> /u/Kevadro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w37l6r/does_anyone_know_how_to_steup_the_steam_deck/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w37l6r/does_anyone_know_how_to_steup_the_steam_deck/">[comments]</a></span>
