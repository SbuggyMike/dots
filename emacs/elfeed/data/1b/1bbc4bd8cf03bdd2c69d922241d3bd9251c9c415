<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would like to have language server completion completion in shell mode. I tried etags and ctags, but they donâ€™t really help that much. Are there any options for getting a more context aware completion in shell?</p> <p>Edit: I should clarify that I want to complete language symbols and project-specific module/function names. I do not need shell command completion - that is a solved problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gammarray"> /u/gammarray </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132y2ac/eglot_or_lsp_complete_in_shell/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132y2ac/eglot_or_lsp_complete_in_shell/">[comments]</a></span>
