<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ive been really into classical music for about 2 years (before that I listened some pieces and film music between songs and stuff), and over the last past year (a bit more probably) I’ve been getting into dissonant music (mostly piano). And I was hoping you guys could give me some recommendations for (borderline)atonal music! </p> <p>For reference some pieces I enjoy:</p> <p>Scriabin - piano sonatas 6-10, vers la flamme &amp; poem nocturne</p> <p>Szymanowski - piano sonata 3 &amp; metopes</p> <p>Roslavets - piano sonata 1, piano trio 3 &amp; cello sonata 2</p> <p>Schönberg - piano concerto</p> <p>Alban Berg - piano sonata </p> <p>Florent Schmitt (not really atonal but it has cool textures) - ombres &amp; mirages</p> <p>Ernst Krenek - piano sonata 4 &amp; string quartet 3</p> <p>Prokofiev - piano sonatas 2,6,7,8, piano concertos 1-3, toccata &amp; suggestion diabolique</p> <p>Hope anyone can help, if yes, thanks in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LisztR"> /u/LisztR </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wg3bt4/could_you_guys_recommend_me_some_good_stuff/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wg3bt4/could_you_guys_recommend_me_some_good_stuff/">[comments]</a></span>
