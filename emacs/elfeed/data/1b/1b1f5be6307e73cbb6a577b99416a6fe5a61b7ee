<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t most people consider the fact that in t20 players are under immense pressure to make rapid runs and take wickets at a faster rate. It&#39;s a fast paced game. So any decision making process by nature is faster. Often taking a single is not enough compared to a test/ODI. I get that many perceive test cricket as best format but t20 does have different merits which are overlooked. We&#39;ve seen a great number of excellent test cricketers failing in t20 format and vice versa. Although t20 and test are different formats of cricket, they are not alternatives. Both have respective markets. T20 is by no means a lesser format.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Scythe365"> /u/Scythe365 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wjsiec/why_is_t20_cricket_so_undermined_in_this_sub/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wjsiec/why_is_t20_cricket_so_undermined_in_this_sub/">[comments]</a></span>
