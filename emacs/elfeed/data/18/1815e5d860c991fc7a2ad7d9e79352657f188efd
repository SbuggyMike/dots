<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I would have a very noob question. I have never been to a classical concert but soon I&#39;m going on holiday to Berlin and I would like to go and listen Mozart Requiem in the Music Hall of Philharmony. Is there a required dress code? Ball gowns or evening wear? Or anything smart looking is enough?</p> <p>I know this is not a strichtly music question, so remove if violates any rules. Thanks for the help though. You would save me the embarassment.</p> <p>update</p> <p>Thanks for the replies. I didn&#39;t think of turning up in shorts and t-shirt, I have some smart-is dresses, just wasn&#39;t sure if it was enough. Mainly as I am more of a goth/metalhead, and in the alt scene you are expected to look part of it. Anyway thanks again. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pitiful-Library-7461"> /u/Pitiful-Library-7461 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wh5hga/dress_code_at_classical_concerts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wh5hga/dress_code_at_classical_concerts/">[comments]</a></span>
