The alcohol industry used its donations to medical research to help
engineer a
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/04/alcohol-wine-drinking-healthy-dangerous-study.html?via=rss">conclusion that a low level of drinking alcohol</a>
was
a little more healthful than abstaining.
<p>
This conclusion was subtly mistaken: in fact, a certain fraction of
the abstainers had decided to abstain because of some illness, and
those illnesses were what made them less well than the typical light
drinker.
