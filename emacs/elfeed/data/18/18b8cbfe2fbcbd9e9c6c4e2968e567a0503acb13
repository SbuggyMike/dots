<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have just bought a new laptop and have been setting up Arch Linux. Everything works great except for a few programs not rendering properly. Certain programs will not render new content until the window is resized. For example, if I run <code>neofetch</code> in a terminal emulator nothing will appear on screen, not even the command I typed, until I resize the window. The programs I have found this occur with are kitty, alacritty, and Spotify. This does not occur with st, Firefox, or LibreOffice. I have not encountered this issue on any other machine I&#39;ve installed Arch Linux to.</p> <p>I will provide some information that may help:</p> <ul> <li>Window Manager: dwm</li> <li>CPU: Intel i7-1280P</li> <li>Graphics: Integrated</li> <li>Screen Resolution: 2256x1504</li> <li>Memory: 16GB</li> </ul> <p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Glowworm04"> /u/Glowworm04 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/133fsub/windows_wont_render_until_they_are_resized/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/133fsub/windows_wont_render_until_they_are_resized/">[comments]</a></span>
