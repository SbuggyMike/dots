Republicans have described a specific plan to
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/kevin-mccarthy-debt-ceiling-bill">impose disaster</a>
specifically on non-rich Americans.

If I were the Democrats, I would tell the Republicans, "If you are
determined to cause a disaster for Americans, you'll have to do it by
yourselves.  We will not participate.  Especially, don't expect we will
help you save the rich while abandoning the poor."
