<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all ! </p> <p>Recent emacs convert here, I&#39;m using emacs with org-mode / org-roam for documentary filmmaking and freelance video work. Still working on a better workflow than what I have currently </p> <p>I was wondering if someone has tried to integrate Emacs with their stream deck ? </p> <p>Here is what I imagine it would be useful for : </p> <p>- starting and stopping project timer with org-clock</p> <p>- global macros for pulling up a new notes or todo entry, or just general emacs macros</p> <p>- macro pad for more exotic commands that one might want to run every so often, or for switching buffers (with preview of the buffer name on the stream deck ?)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>All of these to me seem like feasible and useful. As I am relatively new to programming and elisp, I have a vague idea of how to implement this myself, but if someone has already gone through the trouble I would be happy to hear how they went about it !</p> <p>I use Doom emacs - macros and key bindings are pretty clear and easy to implement but more ways of interacting with emacs would be a plus for me ! </p> <p>I imagine for the global commands something like the emacs api would need to be used, I&#39;ve got to look into it more.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FailedHumanPrototype"> /u/FailedHumanPrototype </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w46dzx/emacs_stream_deck_integration/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w46dzx/emacs_stream_deck_integration/">[comments]</a></span>
