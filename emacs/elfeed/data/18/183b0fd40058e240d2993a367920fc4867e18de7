France has urged the EU to designate
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/10/wagner-should-be-labelled-terrorist-group-france-tells-eu">Wagner as a "terrorist group"</a>.
<p>
Wagner may be guilty of terrorism, but it is an injustice to label any
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2005-may-aug.html#02%20July%202005%20(Calling%20organizations%20terrorists)">person or group as guilty of a crime by mere fiat</a>.
That should always require a fair trial.
<p>
Wagner might be convicted in a fair trial.  It wouldn't astound me.
But it would be a foolish own-goal to try that now.  Given the
appearance of quarrel between Waner's leader Prigozhin and Putin, the
wise strategy is to encourafe Wagner and its leaders to surrender to
Ukraine, by promising them safety if they do.
<p>
Even if that appearance of quarrel is only play-acting, it is
still desirable to exacerbate the tension, as long as this is done
without sacrificing any military advantage.
<p>
In general, I think we should try to avoid applying this spirit of
callous realpolitik to people.  But it is forgivable to do that to
vicious criminals such as Prigozhin and Putin.
