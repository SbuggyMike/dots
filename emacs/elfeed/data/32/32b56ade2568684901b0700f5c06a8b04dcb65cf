Although Graham Mansfield was not convicted of murdering his dying
wife, he was convicted of manslaughter.  His <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/22/man-who-killed-his-wife-in-act-of-love-calls-for-assisted-dying-law">sentence was suspended</a> so
he probably will not go to prison for this.

I don't know whether he cares about that question.  He did not want to
outlive Dyanne, but having survived his suicide attempt, he is stuck
with it.  Can he find meaning in life now?

I believe that the right to die should not be limited to people who
are going to die soon anyway.  People who are incapacitated, whose
prospect is many years of helpless boredom and futility, should have
the right to help in dying, too, if that's what they want.
