<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As I use LUKS and LVM I think a login screen is overkill. I changed <em>/etc/lightdm/ightdm.conf</em> unchecking:</p> <pre><code>autologin-guest=false autologin-user=&lt;username&gt; autologin-user-timeout=0 autologin-session=xmonad </code></pre> <p>I also added &lt;user&gt; to the autologin group:</p> <pre><code>sudo groupadd -r autologin sudo gpasswd -a &lt;username&gt; autologin </code></pre> <p>Although autologin works OK the mouse cursor operates strangely. First after autologin ithe cursor is completely absent on the background wallpaper (as set by nitrogen). The only way I can get it to return is by opening an application and wiggling the mouse around; the cursor then appears normally as an arrow over that application. However, if I return the cursor to the background it appears as a cross. The only way to get an arrow back over the background wallpaper is to reset the cursor setting in lxappearance. The problem appears to occur when the cursor hovers over a graphic file (such as the nitrogen wallpaaper background). Any insight into how to fix the cursor permanently with autologin would be welcome as I don&#39;t want to have to reset the cursor in lxappearance after every boot.
