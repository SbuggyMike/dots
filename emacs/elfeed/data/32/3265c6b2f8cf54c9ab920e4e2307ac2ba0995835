<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been using arch for a long time. I want to swap out my laptop hard drives cause running out of space (and considering starting recording, which will need more space). This means I&#39;ll have to do a repartitioning/reinstall. Which honestly will not be an issue cause I manage my packages and configurations well.</p> <p>Now I got freedom to choose my filesystem and partitioning; I want to take comments on what is good and what is not.</p> <p>If I keep my partitioning layout similar; this is what I&#39;ll end up with</p> <pre><code>nvme0n1 931G ├─nvme0n1p1 550M vfat /efi (esp) └─nvme0n1p2 930G LUKS └─cryptos 930G LVM ├─Laptop-Arch 200G btrfs / (for arch install) ├─Laptop-Gentoo 200G btrfs /media/gentoo (for gentoo install) ├─Laptop-Home 100G ext4 /home (changing small files no cow) ├─Laptop-Seedbox 40G ext4 /media/seedbox (libvirt small VM in vpn) └─Laptop-Opt 200G ext4 /opt (Win10.qcow here) nvme0n2 1862G └─nvme0n1p2 1862G LUKS └─cryptdata 1862G LVM └─LaptopData-Files 1862G xfs /home/data (Link/broadcast contents?) </code></pre> <ul> <li>I have not been able to dedicate time to switch to gentoo full time; but it&#39;s a passion project. Don&#39;t think I will for a while but I like to hack at making it equivalent to my arch installation.</li> <li>I use btrfs and snapper snapshots; though with arch I never used the snapshots.</li> <li>Opt will contain my windows.qcow that I will need for compatibility purposes; and some software that I might want to share.</li> <li>I have a large home directory; but it is due to media. (Static files) I want to toss those media in to the large drive that I will be adding. My thought was to mount the extra drive at /home/data, having the same user as my main user, and use symlinks to link my media from my home folder to the secondary home folder. Is there a better way to do this? I rather keep fstab uninvolved with bind mounts. And at some point; I think I will serve the media contained in the second drive using samba to a kodi box; so if there is a software that can do that and easily enable me to just use served directories as my music folders etc. that would be cool.</li> </ul> <p>My choice of filesystems are btrfs to be able to do snapshots/rollback if I ever need on the root drive, xfs for collection of static and individually large files, and ext4 for everything besides that. Luks on top of lvm just makes encryption super easy and no hassle. I&#39;m open to critique.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wolf__ramite"> /u/wolf__ramite </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5gf3r/reinstalling_any_choice_of_file_systems_or_system/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5gf3r/reinstalling_any_choice_of_file_systems_or_system/">[comments]</a></span>
