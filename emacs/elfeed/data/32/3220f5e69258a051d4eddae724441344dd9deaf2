<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been obsessed with these two symphonies for the past few months and I&#39;m wondering if there were other pieces getting close to this type of sound? There&#39;s something about them, the lower register, the drama, how personal they feel, the sweetness of the melodies, the lushness and power of the orchestration... I already know the 4th, should I try the Manfred? Or other composers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheAskald"> /u/TheAskald </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wjjtsh/pieces_similar_to_tchaikovsky_5_6/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wjjtsh/pieces_similar_to_tchaikovsky_5_6/">[comments]</a></span>
