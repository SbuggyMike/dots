<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ravindra Jadeja is very good at cricket. Of that is no denying. He is an all format allrounder who also happens to be one of the best fielders in the world at the moment. That being said, I think in tests in particular, he is simultaneously both under and overrated by people who don&#39;t look at his record in its entirety.</p> <h1>Raw Averages</h1> <p>Let&#39;s first look at him in the context of all the best test allrounders in history. Specifically I looked at everyone who had over 2,500 runs averaging over 25, and 100 wickets averaging under 41 in tests. The slightly odd 41 chosen so Ravi Shastri can get in with his bowling average of 40.9 and give us a sample of 20 players. </p> <p>Jadeja himself has scored 2,523 runs at 36.5 while taking 242 wickets at just under 25 in tests so far in his career.</p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/IdY4NwR">Here</a> is a plot of those 20 players by batting and bowling average. Jadeja is the larger IND dot in the top right. </p> <p>Obviously one of the more obvious parts of this plot is that Sobers and Kallis were absolute freaks and totally distort things, but let&#39;s ignore them for a second. In general the closer a player is to the top right of the plot, the better an allrounder they were whereas bottom right indicates more of a bowling allrounder and top left more of a batting allrounder. By that measure on this plot the most impressive allrounder when looking at both skills is Imran Khan, followed very closely by Keith Miller who I don&#39;t think gets enough credit. Jadeja and Pollock are the next two closest dots to that top right spot. From this it would be easy to conclude that Jadeja is already one of the very best test allrounders of all time.</p> <h1>Runs Per Innings And Wickets Per Match</h1> <p>However, I would argue that the above plot is misleading. Averages are a poor way of judging allrounders because they don&#39;t in any way capture the way a player was used. To highlight this, here is the same plot again but with a new point added for <a href="https://imgur.com/a/FzukVcw">Alistair Cook</a>. </p> <p>Of course, this is a slightly silly point because given Cook has only taken one test wicket no one in their right mind seriously considers him an allrounder. But he serves to highlight an important point which is that a player&#39;s actual usage isn&#39;t captured by their average. </p> <p>That&#39;s true for bowling, but even for batting averages can be very misleading. Take the batting of Shaun Pollock and Ian Botham for example. Pollock&#39;s batting average of 32.3 is barely a whisker away from Botham&#39;s 33.5, but their batting careers could hardly be more different. Pollock actually played in six more matches than Botham yet Botham has nearly 1,500 more runs as well as 14 centuries to Pollock&#39;s two. On the other hand Pollock has 39 not outs to his name compared to just six for Botham, and Pollock spent nearly two thirds of his career batting at eight or bellow whereas Botham spent 70% of his career batting in the top six.</p> <p>Regardless of any arguments about who was the better batter, how much value not outs have, how each player would have been used different in a different side etc, both players very clearly had very different roles in their respective teams when it came to batting and that&#39;s not reflected in their averages.</p> <p>Therefore to get a better idea of how Jadeja compares to other allrounders than just looking at averages, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZrqDOk7">here</a> is a new plot but with runs per innings and wickets per match instead (nb: there is a discussion on why use runs per innings and wickets per match at the end). </p> <p>This gives us a much more realistic overview of how Jadeja has been used with the bat overall in his career. That is to say relatively sparingly. He scores just under 29 runs per innings and takes just over 4 wickets per match. The latter is outstanding, only beaten by Ashwin and Hadlee who are both really bowling allrounders, and also Imran Khan, but 29 runs per match really isn&#39;t all that spectacular. </p> <p>The reason Jadeja drops down here is he, like Pollock, has spent a lot of time being used as a bowler who can bat, batting at number eight or even nine. In fact 43 of his 89 test innings with the bat have been at eight or below and he was not out in 10 of them. It&#39;s worth comparing him to Shakib who has taken 3.6 runs per test but also scored nearly 37 runs per innings and comes out extremely well on here. </p> <p>Off topic, but just how far to the left of the plot Kallis is really stands out to me and quite clearly shows he was very much used as a batting allrounder.</p> <h1>Jadeja&#39;s Evolution</h1> <p>The story does not end there though. It would now be easy to say Jadeja looks a lot more like a bowling allrounder than a genuine allrounder who can be relied on to score a lot of runs for their team, given his relative meager output with the bat. But once again it&#39;s not so simple. </p> <p>Before the start of the home series against South Africa in 2019 where he was picked to bat at number six, Jadeja had batted at eight or below in 41 of his 63 test innings compared to just four goes in the top six, and despite being not out in nearly a quarter of his innings only averaged 32.5 with less than 25 runs per innings. Since then he&#39;s only batted below seven twice (both times in the same match), he&#39;s averaged 46, and while he&#39;s still boosted somewhat by not outs, his runs per innings has shot up by 12 to 37. The flipside however is his bowling has taken a hit with his wickets per match dropping to 2.6. His full numbers for each section are below.</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th></th> <th>RPI</th> <th>WPM</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>Pre Oct 2019</td> <td>24.8</td> <td>4.6</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Post Oct 2019</td> <td>37.0</td> <td>2.6</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h1>Jadeja in different conditions</h1> <p>This quite nicely illustrates my final point which is where Jadeja plays has a huge impact on his ability to influence a test. In that period up until the 2019 South Africa series he had played just 13 of his 43 tests outside of Asia, since then it&#39;s nine out of 17. There has seemingly been a conscious decision by the Indian management to pick Jadeja as a batter in all conditions who can also provide a spin option. Whereas before he was more of a bowler who can bat to supplement the bowling attack in favourable conditions. A (outrageously good) second spinner to partner Ashwin.</p> <p>The effect it&#39;s had on his batting is plain to see. He&#39;s scoring more runs and winning India matches with the bat. But it has also exposed the fact that when the pitches stop turning he really loses his wicket taking threat. Overall in his career his bowling strike rate shoots up to over 80 outside of Asia and he only takes 2.6 wickets per match. He is still able to keep things very tight, just going at 2.66 rpo, a very valuable asset. But nevertheless the drop-off is stark. Likewise his batting also takes a hit, despite his recent ton in England he&#39;s struggled when he&#39;s left the subcontinent, both overall and in recent times.</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th></th> <th>RPI</th> <th>WPM</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>In Asia</td> <td>30.2</td> <td>4.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Outside Asia</td> <td>25.8</td> <td>2.6</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Putting Jadeja in Asia and Jadeja Outside Asia onto the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/EdcQITI">RPI/WPM plot</a> is telling. If he could recreate his numbers everywhere, Jadeja would have a very good shout of being the greatest test allrounder of all time. On the other hand, outside of Asia you will notice he is just overlapping with an England player, specifically Moeen Ali who, while a good player himself usually isn&#39;t even considered when we talk about test allrounders.</p> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>Like I said in the first line, Jadeja is a fantastic cricketer, in all formats and in tests in particular. Nothing I have written here should suggest otherwise. That being said, I hope I have cast some light on his record and how to interpret it. Showing that while his averages are spectacular, they are somewhat misleading, inflating his impact with the bat. And while he is delivering in his new role that has asked more of him with the bat, the resulting playing outside of Asia more highlights that his game is somewhat limited in certain and suits Asian conditions a lot more than those further afield.</p> <h1>TLDR</h1> <p>Jadeja is a great player overall, but in Asia he is an all time great, outside Asia not so much</p> <h1>Runs per innings and wickets per match discussion</h1> <p>Usually I don&#39;t like to use wickets per match. I think it unfairly penalises bowlers who happen to play in attacks with genuine fifth bowling options, but when we&#39;re talking about allrounders they really should be batting in the top seven a lot of the time which allows for five bowlers to play. </p> <p>The reason to look at wickets per test rather than per innings is if a captain chooses not to use a player at all in an innings it&#39;s usually not a good indictment on that player&#39;s bowling, but their innings bowled in tally doesn&#39;t go up. On the other hand the reason to use runs per innings is usually players will have to bat twice in each innings. There is no real equivalent of just not being asked to bowl. Yes lower order players are more likely to not have to contribute to the bat if their team declares or has a small target to chase so the fact they don&#39;t contribute there is lost, but on the other hand a lot of the teams these players played for often won by an innings or close to it. In Imran Khan&#39;s case Pakistan won 11 of his 89 matches by either an innings or 10 wickets.</p> <p>Really though the difference we&#39;d see going to runs per match or wickets per innings won&#39;t be that big.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Whistopher_Croakes"> /u/Whistopher_Croakes </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w7j92y/untangling_the_test_record_of_ravindra_jadeja/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w7j92y/untangling_the_test_record_of_ravindra_jadeja/">[comments]</a></span>
