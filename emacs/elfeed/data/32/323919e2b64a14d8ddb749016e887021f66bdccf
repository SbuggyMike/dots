<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I am totally confused when it comes to drivers especially graphics drivers. I have dell laptop with Intel and Nvidia graphics card. For some reason my system is using Nvidia card as the default card. From what I read it should be the intel. How do I change my preferred Graphics card. I would like to use my intel to day to day things and use Nvidia for graphics intensive things using prime-run. I am using X11 as display server and sddm as my display manager. I am using proprietary graphics card drivers for Nvidia.</p> <p>Thank you for talking my time to read this. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CJtheDev"> /u/CJtheDev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w53vyc/change_my_preferred_graphics_card/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w53vyc/change_my_preferred_graphics_card/">[comments]</a></span>
