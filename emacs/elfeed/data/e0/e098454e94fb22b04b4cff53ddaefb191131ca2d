Instead of using a boot loader you have a chroot loader? Or is this a stupid idea?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoCSForYou"> /u/NoCSForYou </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5hjaj/can_i_use_an_arch_linux_system_to_use_archchroot/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w5hjaj/can_i_use_an_arch_linux_system_to_use_archchroot/">[comments]</a></span>
