<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently learned Peter Gabriel is not only releasing a new album (i/o) this year, but he&#39;s also embarking on a worldwide tour. It&#39;s been donkey years since I&#39;ve been to a show, but given Peter has been one of my favourites for about 40 years or so, I&#39;d like to go. However, because my eyesight is not great and I&#39;m on a fixed disability income, the $200 - $800 floor seats I&#39;d prefer at CLIMATE Pledge Arena is waaaaaaaaaay out of my budget. Sigh. Maybe in the next life, maybe in the next life...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Comfortable_Front370"> /u/Comfortable_Front370 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1399qyj/whats_the_most_youd_pay_for_a_concert_ticket_today/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1399qyj/whats_the_most_youd_pay_for_a_concert_ticket_today/">[comments]</a></span>
