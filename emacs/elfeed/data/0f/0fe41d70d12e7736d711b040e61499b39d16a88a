<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On a newly installed system the root filesystem is mounted read-only when resuming from hibernation. I&#39;ve never come across this behaviour before and I&#39;m not sure where to start trouble shooting.</p> <p>This is what I do</p> <ol> <li>start up computer</li> <li>verify that <code>/</code> is mounted RW</li> <li>close lid</li> <li>open lid</li> <li>when running <code>mount</code> it looks like <code>/</code> still is RW, but if I run <code>touch foo</code> it fails (after a considerable time), and running <code>mount</code> after that shows that <code>/</code> is RO</li> </ol> <p>I&#39;ve tried remounting RW using <code>mount -o remount,rw /</code>, but that failed. I also can&#39;t run <code>dmesg</code> to see if there are any errors reported there. I&#39;ve also added <code>resume</code> to the list of hooks in <code>/etc/mkinitcpio.conf</code> (and run <code>mkinitcpio -P</code>) but that made no difference.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure where to start looking for the cause.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/magthe0"> /u/magthe0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/130axz0/root_fs_mounted_ro_after_resuming/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/130axz0/root_fs_mounted_ro_after_resuming/">[comments]</a></span>
