<p>&#8216;Baptie v The Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames (2022) EWCA Civ 888. This was a second appeal, brought by RBKT from a s.204 appeal that had overturned their decision that Ms Baptie was intentionally homeless from a housing association property due to rent arrears. The Council review officer had found “that the rent due to the Housing Association had been affordable for Ms Baptie, but she had failed to claim tax credits to which she was entitled and spent an unreasonable amount on living expenses.

The review officer found on these other grounds.)&#8217;</p>
