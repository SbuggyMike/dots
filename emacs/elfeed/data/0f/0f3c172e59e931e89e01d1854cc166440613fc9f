<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m running an external display off DP from my omen 15 2020 laptop (r7 4800h + 1650ti) running arch kde wayland (installed through archinstall, followed everything here: <a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Wayland/Nvidia">https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Wayland/Nvidia</a> )</p> <p>The external monitor just wont run at 144hz, strangely, running glxgears on the external monitor gives me 71.9fps on said display. It shows up as selected in KDE Settings (even the monitor OSD reports 144hz). Changing refresh rates below 60 does seem to take effect though, almost like its capped.</p> <p>Maybe it has something to do with NVIDIA? I don’t really know, i have searched everywhere and found nothing and thus i am asking for help, ill post any necessary info, thanks in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/csgutc777"> /u/csgutc777 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w89uje/144hz_on_external_display_doesnt_work_nvidia_kde/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w89uje/144hz_on_external_display_doesnt_work_nvidia_kde/">[comments]</a></span>
