<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My PC takes a long time to shut down under 5.18.16-arch1-1 and GNOME 42.3.1.</p> <p>This also happens on reboot, I have looked into systemd but could not figure it out. All I see on the screen is a blinking _. Please let me know how to solve this problem as it is quite annoying.</p> <p>Edit:It seemed to be caused by software such as Bottles and Lutris refusing to terminate the process at shutdown. The solution was to terminate all related processes before shutdown.</p> <p>Thanks everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Anertz_0153"> /u/Anertz_0153 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whpcnh/shutdown_takes_a_long_time/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whpcnh/shutdown_takes_a_long_time/">[comments]</a></span>
