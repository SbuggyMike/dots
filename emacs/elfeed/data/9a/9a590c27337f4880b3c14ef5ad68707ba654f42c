<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically the title. My cousin&#39;s son (to me ... ???) is really getting into chess and plays just about every day. Last time I was over there he was studying a chess board by himself! He&#39;s 5 and probably about 700-800, and I wanted to get him something that he could use for years if he decides to stay with chess. Any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DrFlooooooooferstein"> /u/DrFlooooooooferstein </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbexcv/does_anyone_have_a_good_book_or_other_reference/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbexcv/does_anyone_have_a_good_book_or_other_reference/">[comments]</a></span>
