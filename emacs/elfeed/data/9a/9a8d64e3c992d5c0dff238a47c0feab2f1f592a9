<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a new GNU/Linux enthusiast. I deleted Windows from my desktop PC about 2 months ago, I think. I definitely don&#39;t claim to be especially tech savvy, and I realize I do have a learning curve ahead of myself. As an example, I know flatpak and snaps are two types of package managers, but I haven&#39;t really been able to comprehend what exactly are the differences between those. So I do have a lot to learn, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s silly of me. I think it&#39;s mature to admit my knowledge is lacking, while actively seeking to improve it.</p> <p>However, what I wanted to say is, I honestly find that I enjoy Ubuntu, and that I don&#39;t necessarily agree with all the hate directed towards it.</p> <p>Now, first of all, Ubuntu has been mocked for appealing to tech-illiterate people, and for prioritizing the GUI over the CLI. However, I am a gamer first and foremost, that&#39;s the main thing I do on my PC. I already need to do a ton of tinkering. I need to be able to troubleshoot a problem with the game I am trying to run, and attempt to fix it. I find it quite convenient that there is a distro that makes it more convenient. As of right now, with my insufficient knowledge, I wouldn&#39;t want to spend my time tinkering with both my OS AND my games at the same time to get them to run. I think that&#39;s understandable. </p> <p>I find the Desktop Environment to be quite nicely designed. I&#39;ve tried Linux Mint Cinammon on my old laptop and, to be honest, the layout feels a tiny bit cheap in comparison with Ubuntu&#39;s. I know you can always install a different Environment or rice your current layout, but I think that Ubuntu looks pretty slick out of the box.</p> <p>As a gamer, most of my games run pretty well, although there have been exceptions, but I can&#39;t complain about a lack of playable games.</p> <p>I think Ubuntu overall feels slicker, more friendly, and less in-your-face than Windows. I actually feel like I have some level of freedom. I can use the Terminal when I want to, and it&#39;s a valid option, but most of that can be done via the GUI, I am not being coerced on every step to pay for some bullshit subscription-based service, like it was the case on Windows.</p> <p>I honestly don&#39;t see why there is so much Ubuntu hatred. As someone new to operating systems based on the Linux kernel, I find that it&#39;s a more elegant, more friendly, less bloated system than Windows, while remaining easy to use. </p> <p>I think people should stop acting so elitist. As a gamer that doesn&#39;t yet know how to program (I&#39;ve begun learning C++, but so far my knowledge hardly extends below writing and compiling, &quot;Hello World!&quot;) and is still learning the terminal, Ubuntu honestly seems like a pretty good choice. Personally, I feel quite happy and I believe it to be a significant improvement over Windows.</p> <p>What do you think? Am I wrong?</p> <p>I&#39;ve just realized I&#39;ve failed to include that, but I am using 22.04 LTS.</p> <p>Do you believe my opinion to be wrong? Do you hate Ubuntu?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/C111tla"> /u/C111tla </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/witel0/opinion_as_a_new_gnulinux_enthusiast_i_find/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/witel0/opinion_as_a_new_gnulinux_enthusiast_i_find/">[comments]</a></span>
