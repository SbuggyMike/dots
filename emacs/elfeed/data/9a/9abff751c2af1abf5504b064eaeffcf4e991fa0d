<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently installed arch in a (Parallels Desktop) VM. So i also wanted to install parallels tools, it&#39;s a package for parallels VMs that improves communication between the host machine and the VM and stuff like that. However i turns out parallels tools isn&#39;t supported in 5.18, How can i downgrade to 5.17?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Visible-Pop-2576"> /u/Visible-Pop-2576 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wh0eop/downgrading_kernel_version_in_a_vm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wh0eop/downgrading_kernel_version_in_a_vm/">[comments]</a></span>
