*   The impact of fungal disease is expected to worsen, the researchers
   say, as the climate crisis results in temperatures rising and
   fungal infections moving steadily polewards. Since the 1990s,
   fungal pathogens have been moving to higher latitudes at a rate of
   about 7km a year. Wheat stem rust infections, normally found in the
   tropics, have already been reported in England and Ireland.*
