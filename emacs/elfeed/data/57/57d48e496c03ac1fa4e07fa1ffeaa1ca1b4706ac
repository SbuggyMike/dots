<p>Current set of buttons, and a better light-balanced shot - the blank buttons do glow but not enough to stand out in a well-lit room. (If you view them straight on, non of the text is clipped or cropped - at the angle I usually use the device, the text  disappears entirely.) (The clock button runs an xosd script that overlays the clock in big digits in the middle of the screen - I mostly use it when I've got youtube up full screen, otherwise I have a clock in the i3 status bar, and another one in the emacs modeline.)</p>
