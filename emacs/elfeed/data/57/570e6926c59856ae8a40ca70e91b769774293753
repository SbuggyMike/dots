China seems to be
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/28/china-peace-ukraine-xi-jinping-moscow-kyiv">serious about trying</a>
to bring about a peace between Putin and Ukraine.

If China works on this patiently, it may eventually bring about a deal,
provided that the two sides can eventually agree on one.  It would require
Putin to accept concessions which, at present, he is unwilling to accept.
But maybe with time he will change his mind somewhat.
