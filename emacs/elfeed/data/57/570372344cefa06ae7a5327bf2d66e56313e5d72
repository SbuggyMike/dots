Texas is considering many
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/19/texas-criminalize-voter-fraud-bills">new laws to punish fraud in voting</a>,
which almost
never happens in the US.
<p>
I am sure this is blowing smoke so they can claim a fire exists, but I
susepect it is worse than that.
<p>
I think these bills are in fact intended to create opportunities to
intimidate voters &mdash; voters who belong to <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#disprivileged">disprivileged groups</a> and
probably vote Democratic &mdash; by making false accusations and threats.
For instance, the "marshals" could make false accusations on election
day to drive voters away.
