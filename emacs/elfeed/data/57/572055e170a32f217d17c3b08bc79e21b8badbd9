<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello text wizards,</p> <p>I recently switched to <strong>Vertico, Consult, Orderless, Embark, Marginalia</strong> as a completion framework.</p> <p>One hurdle I came across is <strong>Projectile</strong>. I use projectile often (I prefer the extra functionality it has over <strong>project.el</strong>). But how do I integrate Projectile with all this. For <strong>Ivy</strong> there is <strong>counsel-projectile</strong> which overrides most projectile functionality and work awesome. For consult there is <strong>consult-projectile</strong> <del>but it seems a bit lacking</del> compared to counsel-projectile.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Is there a better alternative? or am I missing something with this completion framework and I should combine more consult and embark functionality with projectile somehow?</p> <p>Do you use projectile with a similar completion stack? If so do you have any advice of config files to share?</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>[EDIT] My bad after taking a deeper look to respond to <a href="/u/bespokey">u/bespokey</a> I realized that they are pretty similar not sure why I thought they were more. My bad.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MakeItEnd14"> /u/MakeItEnd14 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wejoc8/help_vertico_consult_orderless_embark_marginalia/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wejoc8/help_vertico_consult_orderless_embark_marginalia/">[comments]</a></span>
