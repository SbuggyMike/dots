<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a question in regards to buffers when using multiple windows. Let&#39;s say I have my frame split into 2 windows. Then, I have <em>Buffer A</em> displaying in Window 1. If I were to open <em>Buffer A</em> in Window 2, I am able to do so with no change to Window 1, etc. </p> <p>This could be a odd late night thought, but is there a way to make <em>Buffer A</em> only displayed in one Window at a time? In my above example, Window 2 currently would display <em>Buffer A</em> and so would Window 1. I want Window 1 to display <em>something else,</em> perhaps another buffer I have opened or even some default value when <em>Buffer A</em> is opened in Window 2. </p> <p>Thanks in Advance. </p> <p>~ Chewy959</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chewy959"> /u/chewy959 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfrwai/buffers_window_is_it_possible_to_keep_buffers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfrwai/buffers_window_is_it_possible_to_keep_buffers/">[comments]</a></span>
