<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am now sitting on the fence between the combination of god-mode, avy, multiple-cursors &amp; expand-region as my current modal setup to just one package that satisfies 95% of my use-cases with those packages.</p> <p>It really is worth checking out. We have:</p> <ol> <li>An easy to follow abstraction model for key-binding.</li> <li>Four modes for interacting with buffers (Normal, Insert, Motion, Beacon)</li> <li>A special command mode called &quot;Keypad&quot;, which does a really good job de-chording your keybinds so you can enter your commands quickly.</li> <li>&quot;Multi-Cursor&quot; editing with macros using that before-mentioned &quot;beacon-mode&quot;</li> </ol> <p>Like god-mode, it gels <em>really</em> well with the default Emacs conventions. If you want to try something cool that doesn&#39;t demand as much as Evil, check it out! </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://i.redd.it/ttlxqok2h0c91.gif">https://i.redd.it/ttlxqok2h0c91.gif</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tangonov"> /u/tangonov </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w0svfs/meow_rocks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w0svfs/meow_rocks/">[comments]</a></span>
