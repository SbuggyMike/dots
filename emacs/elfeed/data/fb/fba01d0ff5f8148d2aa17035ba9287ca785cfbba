<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is anyone here a fan of the quirky and highly original music of the great Danish composer Carl Nielsen . Nielsen was a sort of maverick composer who never began or followed any &quot;isms &quot;. The only ism he followed was individualism . This may explain why his music did not achieve an international reputation until fairly recently , when. Leonard Bernstein. became an enthusiast and. recorded his symphonies 2,34 and 5 . He never did 1 and 6 as far as I know . </p> <p>Bernstein said this about Nielsen - his music is totally unpredictable . Nielsen&#39;s most famous works are his six highly original symphonies , but there are also three concerts, one each for violin, flute and clarinet , his two opera &quot;Saul and David &quot; based on the Bible and the delightful comic opera &quot;Maskarade , four string quartets , his marvelous woodwind quintet , various works for piano , the orchestral works. &quot;Pan &amp; Syrinx &quot;, Helios overture , the &quot;Fantasy overture &quot; An imaginary trip to the Faeroe islands , Saga Dream, based on Norse legends , etc . and many other works . </p> <p>Nielsen&#39;s music is. chock full of energy , enthusiasm, humor , joie de vivre , optimism. and. is always highly inventive . His music is one of the best cures for depression I can think of. . It&#39;s not. darkly atmospheric and. brooding like the music of his friend Sibelius but full of. vivid colors. . It&#39;s not conventionally romantic or late romantic. . Some of. the music he wrote late in life is weirdly experimental. , such as. the. obbligato snare drum part in his 5th symphony. which eventually goes. bonkers and tries to destroy everything going on the music ,improvising the part as if the player had gone berserk . </p> <p>The music of Sibelius is also more adventurous harmonically than that of Sibelius , and while his music is basically tonal, there are passages of atonality is his late works . In his music , a symphony or sonata etc is not rooted to one key , and. he almost never ends of work in the key of the beginning . This is progressive tonality, which was also used by Mahler in some of his symphonies but not as adventurously as Nielsen . When you hear a work f Nielsen for the first time, it will begin in one key, but you can never predict what key it will end in .</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Superhorn345"> /u/Superhorn345 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1303l92/carl_nielsen_18651931/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1303l92/carl_nielsen_18651931/">[comments]</a></span>
