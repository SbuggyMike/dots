<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This has happened to me now a few times on my Thinkpad X1C6 Carbon. Each time I&#39;ve had to reinstall Arch because I could not figure out the problem. I hope someone will be willing to help me troubleshoot.</p> <p>I use ExpressVPN.. Once in a while, I&#39;ll disconnect from ExpressVPN and then restart and as soon as I restart, all networking is broken. Ethernet will not work - can&#39;t ping anything. No wifi networks are showing as available in NMTUI. If I type <code>ip link</code> my wifi adapter shows <code>BROADCAST, MULTICAST</code>. Setting it to <code>UP</code> does nothing but change it to <code>NO-CARRIER</code>.</p> <p>If I look in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, it just shows <code>#Generated by NetworkManager</code>. </p> <p>I uninstalled ExpressVPN and disabled expressvpn.service. I did try to reconnect to ExpressVPN before that but it showed I wasn&#39;t registered so I couldn&#39;t reconnect.</p> <p>If anyone might have an idea of what ExpressVPN is breaking, I&#39;m all ears!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CortisolBump"> /u/CortisolBump </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1398i0i/expressvpn_breaks_networking/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1398i0i/expressvpn_breaks_networking/">[comments]</a></span>
