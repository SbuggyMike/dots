<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, for about a week or two I have noticed that things have randomly been crashing on my install for no apparent reason. Whether it be Firefox, Discord, games, or my entire system, things are just randomly crashing. I have looked through my system logs but have not had any luck finding anything. I do find the core dumps of programs that crashed, but with no hint to what caused it. Has anyone else been experiencing anything similar over the past few weeks, and if so have you found a solution?</p> <p>Specs:</p> <p>R5 2600x</p> <p>RX 5600 XT</p> <p>32 gb ddr4 3600 cl18</p> <p>B450 Tomahawk</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/smi1eybone"> /u/smi1eybone </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w1n52a/things_randomly_crashing_on_my_install/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w1n52a/things_randomly_crashing_on_my_install/">[comments]</a></span>
