<p>&#8216;In this appeal involving indefinite leave to remain (ILR) on the basis of 10 years&#8217; continuous lawful residence and notices, the Court of Appeal held that Mr Marepally whose application for leave to remain had been rejected by a deficient notice, which failed to inform him of his right to appeal, could not rely on section 3C(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 in order to extend his overall period of leave so that he accrued 10 years&#8217; continuous lawful residence. Moreover, the failure to inform him of his right to appeal had caused no injustice as his appeal would have failed in any event. Mr Marepally had a complex immigration history and appealed against the decision that he was not entitled to indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He had entered the UK in February 2009 with entry clearance until 30 April 2014 as a Tier 4 student. Mr Marepally&#8217;s leave to remain as a student was curtailed in January 2014, and his application for further leave to remain was rejected. On 29 April 2014 he applied again (unsuccessfully) for leave to remain as a student. His appeal was eventually allowed on 6 May 2016 after which he varied his April 2014 application (on 25 January 2017) by applying for leave to remain as a Tier 5 worker. That application was refused on 29 March 2017, but the notice was deficient and it did not inform him of his right to appeal.&#8217;</p>
