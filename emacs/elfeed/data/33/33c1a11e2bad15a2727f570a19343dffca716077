<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m having an issue with Chess.com’s game explorer/opening database where it will only show a fraction of my games, i.e. I have 300 games as white in my “archive” but only 8 results show up on the game explorer when I’m try to look at my stats with different openings. Is this a known issue? Is there a huge lag before the games show up in the explorer database?</p> <p>I know that lichess offers this feature as well but I’m hoping for a solution specifically for Chess.com.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chozo003"> /u/Chozo003 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/we3xkj/explorer_feature_on_chesscom_not_showing_all_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/we3xkj/explorer_feature_on_chesscom_not_showing_all_of/">[comments]</a></span>
