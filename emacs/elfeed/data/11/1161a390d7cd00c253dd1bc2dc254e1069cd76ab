Australia has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/11/another-juukan-gorge-darwins-middle-arm-hub-threatens-indigenous-rock-art-traditional-owners-say">approved the construction of new facilities for handling
    natural gas</a> near Darwin, which will surely push the Earth closer to
busting the carbon budget and collapse of civilization.
<p>
The facilities are supposed to include producing "blue hydrogen",
which means hydrogen gas generated by consuming fossil fuels and
generating carbon emissions.  They also include carbon capture and
storage, will encourage using more fossil gas but is unlikely to
actually eliminate its greenhouse emissions.
<p>
If that were not bad bad enough, the currently approved development
area comes pretty close to an aboriginal rock art site.  If
development extends, it could reach that site and endanger it.
<p>
Australian rock art is amongst the oldest cultural relics of
humanity and no one should have the power to authorize damaging it.
