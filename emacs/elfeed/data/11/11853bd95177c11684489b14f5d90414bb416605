<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m seeing a lot of marketing surrounding ChromeOS Flex and many YouTubers, who didn&#39;t even know what an OS is are making videos claiming ChromeOS Flex to be the only OS in existence that can make your old PC come back to life. Obviously, all of this is pretty frustrating to look at when you already know the better alternatives.</p> <p>One claim that often seems to come up, is ChromeOS is backed by a big corporation. A corporation you can &#39;trust&#39; (whatever that means) and a corporation that has the best privacy and security measures for an OS.</p> <p>So I&#39;d like to ask, how much worse is ChromeOS from a security and privacy standpoint, compared to other beginner distros like ZorinOS, Linux Mint or Ubuntu. As a FOSS fan, I obviously have a bias against it but I&#39;d like to hear some opinions and objective points.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NayamAmarshe"> /u/NayamAmarshe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wbancl/chromeos_flex_security_and_privacy_compared_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wbancl/chromeos_flex_security_and_privacy_compared_to/">[comments]</a></span>
