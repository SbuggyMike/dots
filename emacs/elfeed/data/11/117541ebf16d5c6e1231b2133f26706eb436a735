<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used fedora for a while on my Legion 5, and it was great, just a little annoying with some stuff, like grub2 and so on.</p> <p>everything ran perfectly... games, VMs, Visual Studio, everything... but I decided to go back to arch because the AUR is just that valuable to me, it is like 10x faster in my country (Jordan), and it&#39;s much more flexible.</p> <p>anyways, just after installing fedora, I notice that my gnome control center thingy had a power profile option, and i believe it just nerfed my laptops preformance just a bit, but gave a noticable impact to battery life.</p> <p>is there anything similar here on arch, ive been looking and all i found was complicated and scary software that gives full control of power... and i definately dont want that.</p> <p>and please tell me if I should remove this post from here, and why (i is a noob normie).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Soullessboi_iii"> /u/Soullessboi_iii </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13j9squ/how_does_fedora_do_its_laptop_power_profiles_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13j9squ/how_does_fedora_do_its_laptop_power_profiles_or/">[comments]</a></span>
