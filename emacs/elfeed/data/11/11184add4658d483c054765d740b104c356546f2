With Russia and China not participating and France not fielding its top players, I thought (like many others) that the US will clean sweep through the event with ease, India A will get 2nd and the remaining teams will scamper for third. </p> <p>But the way the kids showed up, made it one of the most entertaining olympiads in recent times. Sure, you could argue that the US underperformed. Still the top 3 are well deserving of their place. It&#39;s not just the quality of the play by these teams (which has been top notch) but the attacking (and entertaining) chess we got to watch (and not those dead grandmaster draws). </p> <p>Hopefully, the final day is as exciting! Have fun everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/na6sin"> /u/na6sin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/kkbwei7lxlg91.jpg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wjss8j/the_teams_most_likely_to_finish_on_the_podium_in/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
