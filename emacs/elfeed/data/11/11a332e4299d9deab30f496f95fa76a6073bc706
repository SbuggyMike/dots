<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The intention the tech industry is moving away from x86_64 to ARM is quite fascinating. Ever since Apple made their M1 chips Windows seems to have increased efforts to move to ARM, Ubuntu has a ARM variant as well etc. I know that Arch ARM exists but it isn&#39;t <em>officially</em>‚Äç supported. Considering the performance vs cost benefits of ARM based hardware, it appears to me that pretty soon x86_64 will become obsolete and will be replaced by ARM hardware. It will be quite very sad if I can&#39;t use my favourite Operating System, I imagine it will take quite some work to provide compatibility for ARM hardware. So are there plans to at least start work in the side for ARM compatibility ? What is the current state of such a project if it exists ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wonderful_Voice_9911"> /u/Wonderful_Voice_9911 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2ykz2/are_there_plans_to_officially_support_arch_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2ykz2/are_there_plans_to_officially_support_arch_linux/">[comments]</a></span>
