<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am running archlinux on a laptop (Acer Predator Helios 300). I was monitoring my laptop&#39;s temperature via <code>auto-cpufreq --stats</code> and found out that one of the cores of my CPU (i7 11800H) was reaching 80-85C. So I decided to install some utility which would allow me to ramp up the fan speed. I followed the instructions on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fan_speed_control">archwiki</a> for fan-control.</p> <p>As the wiki suggested, I started by first installing <code>lm_sensors</code> (it was already present so I didn&#39;t install it again) and then running <code>sudo sensor-detect</code>. I answered yes to all of the <code>sensor-detect</code>&#39;s prompts.</p> <p>After this I ran <code>sensors</code> (without <code>sudo</code>). But in my case it was not able to detect any fans. Here is its output:</p> <pre><code>ucsi_source_psy_USBC000:001-isa-0000 Adapter: ISA adapter in0: 0.00 V (min = +0.00 V, max = +0.00 V) curr1: 0.00 A (max = +0.00 A) BAT1-acpi-0 Adapter: ACPI interface in0: 17.27 V curr1: 0.00 A iwlwifi_1-virtual-0 Adapter: Virtual device temp1: +47.0°C nvme-pci-e100 Adapter: PCI adapter Composite: +55.9°C (low = -0.1°C, high = +79.8°C) (crit = +81.8°C) Sensor 1: +55.9°C (low = -273.1°C, high = +65261.8°C) acpitz-acpi-0 Adapter: ACPI interface temp1: +55.0°C (crit = +110.0°C) </code></pre> <p>Why is <code>sensors</code> unable to detect fans? Can I go on with the installation even if no fan is detected?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pr0_Disappointment"> /u/pr0_Disappointment </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wdhggp/sensors_not_detecting_any_fans/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wdhggp/sensors_not_detecting_any_fans/">[comments]</a></span>
