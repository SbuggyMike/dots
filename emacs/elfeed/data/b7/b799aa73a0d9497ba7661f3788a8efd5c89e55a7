<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Currently there is a serious issue happening in RPMFusion, fedora&#39;s suggested third-party repo of obtaining things that fedora refuses to ship.</p> <p>RPMFusion ships mesa-freeworld, a full package compared with fedora&#39;s native stripped mesa version, which works as an essential part for many daily things like hardware acceleration for AMD users. </p> <p>There has been a severe bug between RPMFusion and Fedora for some days, which may result in partial upgrade and mesa lib version mismatch for Fedora mesa-freeworld users. Users who upgraded their mesa and had this mismatch may experience gpu hang, broken desktop, and completely borked system.</p> <p>Users who had been running mesa-freeworld and has not yet upgraded should avoid update at this time, until a proper fix is out. Users who updated their mesa and are experiencing this issue could get a temporary workaround from the links in below.</p> <p>The issue is NOT FIXED as of writing. </p> <p><a href="https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6613">https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6613</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2187726">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2187726</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/131lvjp/system_got_totally_borked_after_upgrading_to_mesa/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/131lvjp/system_got_totally_borked_after_upgrading_to_mesa/</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/131u1n6/mesa_freeworld_maintainers_need_to_start/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/131u1n6/mesa_freeworld_maintainers_need_to_start/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LunaSPR"> /u/LunaSPR </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/132u5gs/fedora_users_with_rpmfusion_and_mesafreeworld/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/132u5gs/fedora_users_with_rpmfusion_and_mesafreeworld/">[comments]</a></span>
