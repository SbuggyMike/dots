Overextension of the crime of "terrorism" in Georgia has been used
to terrorize environmentalist protesters.  A
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/04/24/oregon-domestic-terrorism-law/">similar law in Oregon
may be</a>
used to do likewise.

The article linked to just above displays symbolic bigotry by
capitalizing "black" but not "white".  (To avoid endorsing bigotry,
capitalize both words or neither one.)  I denounce bigotry, and
normally I will not link to articles that promote it.  But I make
exceptions for some articles that I consider particularly important.
That article is one of the exceptions.


<a href="2010-jan-apr.html#30 April 2010 (Deepwater Horizon clean-up begins)">After the Big Spill</a>
in the Gulf of Mexico, <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#bp">Billionaire Polluters</a> hired thousands
of workers to clean away the oil.  Now they are suing because they
have a tendency toward a specific pattern of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/23/bp-oil-spill-deepwater-horizon-key-findings-worker-health-lawsuits">illnesses, which is
likely to have been caused by contact</a>
with the oil.
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill">BP cut corners on safety to save money</a>
at its workers' expense.  Some of the workers on the drilling platform were killed in the explosion that
BP didn't prevent.  The cleanup workers' illnesses are an extension of that same practice.
