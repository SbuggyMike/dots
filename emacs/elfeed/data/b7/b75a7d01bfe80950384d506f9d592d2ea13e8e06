<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! Highschool chess player here, gonna participate in a school tournament for chess. We&#39;ll be given 10 minutes time, and I&#39;ll play on Monday. It&#39;s Saturday afternoon right now and I&#39;m making sure to eat chocolate and other kinds of recommended foods for the brain. I&#39;ve studied for a week and warmed up, but my time trouble is.. terrible. Any tips out there? I&#39;d really appreciate it, thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SuspiciousTwo469"> /u/SuspiciousTwo469 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132l6ji/tips_for_a_school_blitz_tournament/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132l6ji/tips_for_a_school_blitz_tournament/">[comments]</a></span>
