<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello fellow pianist and music enthusiasts, i have finished learning Chopin&#39;s C sharp minor no. 20, and wanted to try out the Nocturne in D flat major Op. 27 No. 2. My question is, will it be to big of a difficulty gap? I learned the C sharp minor without any significant difficulty problems. I also feel that the polyrhythms in the D flat major piece can get into muscle memory through enough practice?</p> <p>anyway, stay safe and healthy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zizto"> /u/Zizto </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wga1e0/how_difficult_is_chopins_nocturne_in_d_flat_major/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wga1e0/how_difficult_is_chopins_nocturne_in_d_flat_major/">[comments]</a></span>
