Dozens of women who worked for the CIA have accused it of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/05/03/cia-sexual-misconduct-discrimination/">disregarding
    accusations of some sort of sexual pressure on them</a>.

It is not clear to me what the bounds of the term "sexual assault" are.
The term is so loose that it is inherently misleading.  But whatever
it includes, the CIA should have handled these accusations properly.
