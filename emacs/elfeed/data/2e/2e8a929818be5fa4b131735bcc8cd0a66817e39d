<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>sorry for the newbie quetion, I thought I got this but clearly I was wrong. So basically I want to modify a previous commit in my repo (by adding some modifications I already have in my workspace). Following a suggestion from Magit&#39;s author (here <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/22565/29817">https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/22565/29817</a>), Magit seems to have a command that should work pretty well for me: `magit-rebase-edit-commit`, bound by default to `r m`. Point is, when I do that, I see the buffer you see in the picture. If I need to add some lines to this commit, what should I do, since there&#39;s no &quot;Unstaged files&quot; section?</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/4owtx6p9zwc91.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=149f2a30930da94d5265d08340d435dab1904d6d">https://preview.redd.it/4owtx6p9zwc91.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=149f2a30930da94d5265d08340d435dab1904d6d</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alessandrobertulli"> /u/alessandrobertulli </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w4ff84/how_to_modify_a_previous_commit_with_magit_i_cant/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w4ff84/how_to_modify_a_previous_commit_with_magit_i_cant/">[comments]</a></span>
