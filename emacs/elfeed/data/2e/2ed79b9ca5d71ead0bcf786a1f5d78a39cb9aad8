<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For a long time I&#39;ve been looking for a good and easy solution for Emacs modifier and other keys being dropped when using the terminal. Not sure why it took me a long time but <a href="https://github.com/CyberShadow/term-keys">https://github.com/CyberShadow/term-keys</a> did the trick!</p> <p>That&#39;s really it! I just wanted to share the win here. This matters in case you have to do full remote development, considerably more than a few edits and commands with TRAMP which is also a fantastic builtin utility and daily driver for me.</p> <p>One thing it doesn&#39;t do, and I&#39;m not sure it can on the MacOS terminal emulator is differentiate TAB and C-i which matters for folks that use org and evil. My solution was to rebind org-cycle to &quot;q&quot; (default is vim macro recording which I don&#39;t typically use). </p> <p>Anywho that&#39;s it, just wanted to post a success story here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aaronemassey"> /u/aaronemassey </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wc9i0z/terminal_emacs_keyinputs_success_story/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wc9i0z/terminal_emacs_keyinputs_success_story/">[comments]</a></span>
