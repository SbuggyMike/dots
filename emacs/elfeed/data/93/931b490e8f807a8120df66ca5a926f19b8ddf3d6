<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For example something like the Cricbuzz app that shows the score and commentary but additionally also shows you cool stats like when Babar Azam is batting in an ODI against England in England then the app could show interesting stats like “Babar Azam’s average in England” or “Highest ODI average for a subcontinental batsman in England” or “Joe Root’s test average in Subcontinent” if let’s say Root is playing against India in a test. Honestly, I’m hungrily waiting for the commentators to call the stats out on tv and for the stats man to put some cool stuff up. But it’d be nice for these stats to be present at the tip of my fingers. Yes there’s espncricinfo but then you have to filter all the stuff out manually. So it doesn’t lend itself to a smooth mobile experience.</p> <p>Does anyone know of an app like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cryptobattery"> /u/cryptobattery </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w979a5/is_there_an_app_for_that_a_companion_app_that/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w979a5/is_there_an_app_for_that_a_companion_app_that/">[comments]</a></span>
