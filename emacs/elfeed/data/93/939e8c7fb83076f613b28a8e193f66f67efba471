<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I started to worry a little about this question, because I randomly asked my 1930 FIDE friend what goes around in his head while playing OTB match and he said that he just calculates and that he doesn&#39;t really talk to himself, which got me confused, because after an opening I am really just talking to myself and trying to figure out the position by explaining it to myself: I am trying to figure out my opponent&#39;s weak squares, pawn breaks, diagonals and so on, while also calculating but only after figuring out where I am stronger and where do I need to make progress. For reference: I am 1400 FIDE and playing OTB matches for 8 months so I am still discovering new things and massive improvements in my game, and I wonder if my approach to a game of chess is good or it could be better. I think that you need both in a balance: Figure out the plan for yourself and you can achieve that by talking to yourself: explaining the position to yourself, while also calculating my moves and my opponent&#39;s best responses. It is true tho I talk to myself a lot outside of chess out loud or in my head, doesn&#39;t matter. I want to hear your opinions about this question since I think too much thinking and not calculating can also slow your thinking process as in reading in your head, where you need to wait for your own voice to catch up to your reading.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Or maybe i&#39;m just overthinking things lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xDhahahaxD"> /u/xDhahahaxD </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jtarz/do_you_talk_to_yourself_in_your_head_throughout/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jtarz/do_you_talk_to_yourself_in_your_head_throughout/">[comments]</a></span>
