<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For other applications I&#39;ve been using <code>prime-run</code> to make sure they are rendered on the gpu, but yesterday I installed steam with the nvidia-utils group and tried to run CSGO. As that performed worse than it should on my laptop I looked at <code>nvtop</code> and saw a flatline graph and nothing but a single Xorg process listed with the gpu.</p> <p>What&#39;s the best way to make sure all steam games run on the GPU? Is there some kind of global X11 setting that can make sure that e.g. fullscreen programs are running on the GPU? Or can I set this on steam?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mithrandir2k16"> /u/Mithrandir2k16 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8f6vi/how_to_make_sure_steam_titles_run_on_the_gpu/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8f6vi/how_to_make_sure_steam_titles_run_on_the_gpu/">[comments]</a></span>
