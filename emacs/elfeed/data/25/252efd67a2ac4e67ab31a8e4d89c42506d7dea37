<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I recently learnt that magit does tags! I am wondering, how does one tag a remote branch though? I have gone through the <a href="https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Tagging.html">manual</a> but couldn&#39;t figure it out. Maybe some more experienced folk here can help me?</p> <p>Also, is there any way one can do gitlab release tags from magit? Seeing as it is probably a gitlab-specific implementation rather than a feature in git proper, am I right in assuming that this is not possible ?</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cellular--automaton"> /u/cellular--automaton </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wd2s2b/magit_tags/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wd2s2b/magit_tags/">[comments]</a></span>
