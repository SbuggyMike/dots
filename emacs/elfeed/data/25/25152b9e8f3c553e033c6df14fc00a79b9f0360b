More reason to suspect that Tories have introduced voter IDs as a means
to prevent legitimate voters from voting is that they plan not to report
how many people
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/27/tory-minister-rachel-maclean-mps-voter-id">show up to vote and are turned away</a>.
<p>
That number would be an underestimate of the number actually blocked
from voting.  Some of them, knowing they didn't get the required ID
card, will not come to the polls at all.
<p>
The people most likely to fail to get the ID card are those who can barely
keep up with their work and family duties, and have little time to spare
to get the ID card.
