<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently installed Emacs + SLIME + SBCL to learn Common Lisp. At first, I installed SLIME through MELPA. Everything worked fine for a while, but because I&#39;m new to Emacs, I believe I pressed a wonky key-combination at some point. Whatever the case, <code>C-c C-c</code>, <code>C-c C-k</code>, etc are all broken. When I try any of these key combinations while in a buffer that isn&#39;t the REPL, I just get <code>C-c C-[whatever] is undefined</code>. Additionally, code hints don&#39;t show up in the bottom bar anymore unless I&#39;m in the REPL, and auto-indentation has stopped working.</p> <p>When I start up Emacs, I first press <code>M-x slime</code>. This starts up the inferior Lisp buffer, then the SLIME REPL. The REPL works fine. Next, I press <code>C-x C-f test.cl</code> or whatever I want to name my file. The file opens up in a separate buffer. I can save changes to it, and I can manually <code>(load &quot;test.cl&quot;)</code> from the REPL, but <code>C-c C-c</code> and similar commands don&#39;t work within this file buffer.</p> <p>What I&#39;ve tried: </p> <p>Restarting Emacs</p> <p>Restarting Emacs after running <code>killall emacs</code> just to be sure</p> <p>Deleting old session files from <code>~/.emacs.d</code> and restarting again</p> <p>Moving my <code>~/.emacs</code> file, starting Emacs, closing Emacs, moving the file back, and starting Emacs again (not sure if this would actually do anything)</p> <p>Restarting my computer</p> <p>Uninstalling Emacs and SLIME, deleting <code>~/.emacs</code> and <code>~/.emacs.d</code>, then reinstalling both, without using MELPA this time</p> <p>The problem persists. What should I try?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/slime_throwaway"> /u/slime_throwaway </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vym7h2/slime_cc_commands_not_working/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vym7h2/slime_cc_commands_not_working/">[comments]</a></span>
