<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My trusted old Dell Latitude e7470 is nearing its end, so I am currently looking for a new notebook. I am running Arch Linux exclusively, so I need one that has relatively good Linux support and fits my other requirements.</p> <p>So far, I like the Thinkpad T14s AMD G3 (which should be coming out soon?), does anyone have any experience with the new Ryzen processors? Do they work as flawlessly as the Intel ones? What about thinkpads in general?</p> <p>Are there any alternatives anyone can recommend? I&#39;ve been thinking about Tuxedo computers but they don&#39;t have on-site repair and none of their current offers completely convinces me. I would like to have a notebook from the business segment, e.g. high quality materials, matte full hd screen, good keyboard (although it looks as if I will have to get used to these super-low travel keyboards). If there are education discounts that would be perfect.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gasp0de"> /u/Gasp0de </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wdefjd/notebook_recommendation_or_experience_with_amd/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wdefjd/notebook_recommendation_or_experience_with_amd/">[comments]</a></span>
