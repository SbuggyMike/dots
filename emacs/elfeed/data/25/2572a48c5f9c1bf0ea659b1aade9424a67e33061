I wanted to spend my weekend a bit differently than usual, and since I live reasonably close to the venue (~60kms away), I decided to attend it. Got the tickets from the <a href="https://tickets.aicf.in/">All India Chess Federation&#39;s Website</a> for Hall 1 (there are 2 halls, in case you weren&#39;t aware - Top 28 teams in Open Section and 21 teams in Women&#39;s section play in Hall 1 and rest of the teams play in Hall 2).</p> <p>Coming to the topic, the experience was surreal (atleast for me, this was the first time I was attending a tournament of such grandeur). The playing hall was massive, well ventilated, well setup (players were happy that the hall was not cramped for space and they could freely move around). The fact that these arrangements were made at a relatively short span of time is really commendable. I was awe-struck the moment I entered the venue.</p> <p>Regarding the arrangements for visitors/spectators, there were no seating arrangements made in Hall 1. We had to stand and watch the games. We were also allowed to move around and watch a few other boards too. But since there are around 49 teams, there wasn&#39;t a lot of space to move around (see pic, the portion outside the temporary barriers placed is the visitors&#39; area) and not all boards were clearly visible. But fortunately, we got to see a lot of top teams closeby today.</p> <p>Norway Open Team, Indian Open B team, Nederlands Open team were amongst the teams that were seated near these temporary walls. So, we were able to get a close look of their games. Also, to add to the excitement, Magnus was playing and we were lucky enough to see his game standing pretty close. I don&#39;t want to get into the games as that is not what I intend to do in this post.</p> <p>It was an amazing experience to say the least. Watching top players in action from a close distance is what everyone who attend tournaments in person would look forward to. And today I got to experience that. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of kids (5-8 year olds) enjoying this. I overheard them whispering the names of the players to their parents. It was so nice to watch them rush to players to get autographs after their games were over. The hall was very silent for the most part and volunteers were working very hard to keep things under control. Kudos to their efforts!</p> <p>But, it was not all rosy. There were a few things I felt could&#39;ve been better. As mentioned before, the walking area for spectators was not spacious enough and it&#39;s very difficult to stand and watch for 4-5 hours continuously (my back is aching very badly now). Hall 2 I heard has seating arrangements. Though we won&#39;t get this feel of standing close and watching the games, I felt they should&#39;ve atleast provided some chairs to sit and rest for sometime.</p> <p>Also, though we were allowed to walk around and see other boards, many boards weren&#39;t visible as they were seated far away from the walking area and spectators aren&#39;t allowed to get there. Also, there was no display of the playing boards. So, we didn&#39;t have any idea of what was happening on the other boards. I was expecting the games to the displayed on a television/projector, so we can have a snapshot of the games all time. As we were asked to deposit our electronic items in the cloak room, there was no way we could know that.</p> <p>To sum it up, it was a great overally experience for me and a day well spent. Got to click a pic with Parham Maghsoodloo and got autographs from quite a few players including Aryan Tari, Sam Shankland, Pentala Harikrishna and Parham Maghsoodloo himself. Special mention to Aryan Tari who gave a big wide smile after signing on my notebook:) Slighly disappointed that I couldn&#39;t get a pic/autograph from Magnus, he was surrounded by a lot of people and he couldn&#39;t stand there for a long time.</p> <p>Here&#39;s a nice picture of the playing hall if y&#39;all are interested.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/vfrmb6oa6re91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f79a54d07288fabe5e5b59be0b6d767d44d944b4">https://preview.redd.it/vfrmb6oa6re91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f79a54d07288fabe5e5b59be0b6d767d44d944b4</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/siiingintherain"> /u/siiingintherain </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wc5egr/chess_olympiad_2022_inperson_experience/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wc5egr/chess_olympiad_2022_inperson_experience/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
