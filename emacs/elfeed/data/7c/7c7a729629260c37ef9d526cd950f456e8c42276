<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Downvote or delete if necessary, but I’m in Boston, visiting Harvard. There’s this little outdoor area with 6 or so chess boards and people sitting at them. I figured it was worth the $5 to get my ass handed and have a good story. </p> <p>We decided no time increments, I drew black. He opened with a funny kings knight opening that transposed into an English. </p> <p>I did a Sicilian invitation that ended up being quite symmetrical. Ended up sacrificing my bishop for two pawns and had excellent piece activity and prepared to lock down my defense and push my pawns. </p> <p>I ended up finding a really nice combination that would have put me up an exchange. He ended up miscalculating and I won a knight for free, after which he resigned. </p> <p>My fiancée couldn’t give two shits, she was a bit annoyed I took over an hour, but she was a trooper. I just feel amazing and don’t really have anybody to explain this feeling to and wanted to post here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tsavorite4"> /u/tsavorite4 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wg0frj/on_vacation_and_i_played_some_random_guy_otb_at/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wg0frj/on_vacation_and_i_played_some_random_guy_otb_at/">[comments]</a></span>
