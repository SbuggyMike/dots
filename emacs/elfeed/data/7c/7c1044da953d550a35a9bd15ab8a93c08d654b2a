*The coronation [in the UK] pulled a screen across a desperate,
failing nation &mdash; just as intended.
Those who opposed it must be portrayed as radical, or the whole rotten
system it

If I imagine myself as British, I do not see myself as opposing either
the coronation or the monarchy.  I simply see them as side issues.
Queen Elizabeth II was not responsible for the Tory policy of
repression and impoverishment of the poor, nor for Starmer's ruination
of the Labour party.  Those are what's really bad about the UK
government.
