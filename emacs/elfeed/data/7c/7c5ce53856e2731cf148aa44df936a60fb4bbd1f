<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(Disclaimer: I don&#39;t use emacs; I just have ulnar nerve entrapment from programming and discovered emacs pinky.)</p> <p>For the past 7 weeks, my pinky and ring finger have been in a constant state of &quot;pins and needles.&quot; The onset was gradual but transitioned into being 24/7, though without pain at first. I thought it was from sleeping on my elbow - not an uncommon cause of ulnar nerve entrapment, and my doctor had me change sleeping positions. </p> <p>I&#39;m developing apps full time in dart and spend about 8-12 hours a day programming, 6-7 days a week. And I save, copy, paste, undo, redo, among other shortcuts all day, probably having my pinky hit the left ctrl key 1000 times a day. My typing speed was normally over 160, max 183, on 10fastfingers. </p> <p>Look, I&#39;ve rebinded left control entirely to left alt. But for some reason, it really hit me today. Suddenly, I was in so much pain that I couldn&#39;t bear to hit left ctrl. </p> <p>I&#39;m asking here because I&#39;m hoping someone else has gone through recovery. I can&#39;t see a specialist for a couple of months. I&#39;ll discontinue using my small finger for shortcuts entirely, but that doesn&#39;t help me. I have a job to do now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AMPHETAMINE-25"> /u/AMPHETAMINE-25 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vw9uq5/emacs_pinky_after_the_damage_has_been_done/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vw9uq5/emacs_pinky_after_the_damage_has_been_done/">[comments]</a></span>
