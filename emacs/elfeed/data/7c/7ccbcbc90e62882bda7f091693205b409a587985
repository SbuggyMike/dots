<p>Another fun experiment with Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC)! I feed the following prompt to Dall-E and Midjourney:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emacs as an anime girl</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-api-now-available-in-public-beta">Dall-E</a>
generation:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.midjourney.com/app/">Midjourney</a> generation:</p>

<p><img alt="midjourney emacs as an anime girl" src="https://i.imgur.com/EhPbLWz.jpg" /></p>

<p>We can see that AI is trying blend the purple from the Emacs logo with
the anime style.</p>

<p>Personally I like MidJourney one better as it has more details and
closer to what we usually perceive anime.</p>

<p>What do you think? Feel free to drop me a note!</p>
