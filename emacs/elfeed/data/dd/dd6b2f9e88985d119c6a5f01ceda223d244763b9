<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I updated my system this evening. Rebooted. Crashed with the weirdest messages I&#39;ve ever seen. I thought at first something went poof with the hardware. I went under the hood and checked everything. Rebooted. Same wack errors and a total lockup. (Not a normal crash, but a screen full of USB information. No logs, no actual crash, just locks up there. Add a USB device and it responds with what is plugged in.</p> <p>In 12+ years of using my OS of choice, I&#39;ve never seen something like this. Turns out I wasn&#39;t losing my mind. Someone pushed a kernel update that completely hammers an AMD CPU/GPU combo...which I have. (FX CPU RX 550 GPU)</p> <p>The issue is so raw/new I couldn&#39;t find anything on the boards. Discord, apparently, is the new &quot;go-to&quot; for issues. (The modern version of &quot;IRC&quot;. heh.) Turns out there are a bunch of folks flipping out. One small addition to the kernel boot line and back in business.</p> <p>The kernel line addition which gets things patched (for now):</p> <p>&quot;spectre_v2=off&quot;</p> <p>#Discord ain&#39;t just for chit-chat anymore. :-D</p> <p>Discord server: Arch Linux Community</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CJPeter1"> /u/CJPeter1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wddj07/amd_51815_kernel_is_a_problem_solution_at_the_end/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wddj07/amd_51815_kernel_is_a_problem_solution_at_the_end/">[comments]</a></span>
