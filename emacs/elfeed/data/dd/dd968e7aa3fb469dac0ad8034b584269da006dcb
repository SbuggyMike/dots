<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I <strong>invite you to join</strong> our Discord group (450 members) to <strong>perform</strong>. Our group is used to ask questions, ask for motivation, and post daily about our practice (accountability challenge). At the end of each month, we have a small recital where we play any music. However, <em>August 22nd will be Debussy&#39;s 160th birthday anniversary.</em> For this day, you can play something by Debussy or another French composer. </p> <p><strong>How it works:</strong> you connect to a voice channel, unmute yourself, and perform. No one can see you. After you finish performing, you can mute yourself again, and listen to other performers. ðŸ˜Š </p> <p>Any <strong>hesitation</strong>? How I think about this, is, no one knows who I am, so it doesn&#39;t matter what the listeners think. I am performing for myself, and I&#39;m practicing <em>my performance skill.</em> That&#39;s why I&#39;ve performed over 30 times in the past 3 years! </p> <p>If interested, the link is <a href="https://discord.gg/x3w46XH">https://discord.gg/x3w46XH</a> </p> <p>All levels are welcome -- we don&#39;t judge, but motivate à¬˜ (à©­ËŠê’³Ë‹) à©­âœ§</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/E-Emily"> /u/E-Emily </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wdon4o/resource_would_you_like_an_opportunity_to_perform/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wdon4o/resource_would_you_like_an_opportunity_to_perform/">[comments]</a></span>
