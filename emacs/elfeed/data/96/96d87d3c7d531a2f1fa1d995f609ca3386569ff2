<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Honestly, it has been really fun to try out such a minimalist distro like Arch because not only I learned and understood better my computer but also I was kinda forced to understand how to create directories, install packages and even learning a text editor in order to edit some config files. It has been a very fun experience, especially the part where I had to install and configure the tiling window manager. Anyways I love Arch Linux because you can make it yourself and that is one of the best things so far while using it, I still have to learn a lot though.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antri7"> /u/antri7 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfk2wc/finally_installed_arch_linux_for_the_first_time_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfk2wc/finally_installed_arch_linux_for_the_first_time_a/">[comments]</a></span>
