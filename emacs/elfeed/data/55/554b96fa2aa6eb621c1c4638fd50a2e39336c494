The coronation of Charles III was
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/07/coronation-just-stop-oil-republic-activists-peaceful-protests">an occasion for repression</a>
such as
one would have expected from an old-time monarch, if the monarch was
lacking in regal magnanimity.
<p>
About 20 Just Stop Oil protesters were arrested for wearing t-shirts
and carrying small flags, which they planned to respectively expose
and wave.  Another 20 antimonarchists were arrested for taking nonviolence
training in another city.
<p>
In all, 52 protesters and would-be protesters were arrested.  A minister
said this was justified because the UK's
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/07/police-right-to-arrest-coronation-protesters-as-uk-on-global-stage-says-minister">show had to look good</a>.
<p>
In my view, those arrests showed off what's bad and getting worse in
the UK: uniformed <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/07/police-are-curbing-free-speech-not-just-at-behest-of-right-crackdown-mall">have been authorized</a>
to draw the boundaries
of lawful and unlawful protest.
