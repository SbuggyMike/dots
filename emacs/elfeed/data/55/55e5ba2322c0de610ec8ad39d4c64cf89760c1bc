<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the past couple months now my GPU has been crashing my computer randomly, usually when GPU load spikes really high. The issue is that I can&#39;t seem to find anything in the Xorg log or my journalctl about this</p> <p>I can consistently get a crash with Unigine Heaven and would like to isolate the cause of this, even if it means a hardware failure, but I have little to no idea of how to actually log and/or find this information on Linux. Especially since the normal sources I&#39;ve found have not actually presented any errors</p> <p>System info:</p> <p>GPU: Sapphire RX 570 4GB - may or may not have been used for mining, do not know</p> <p>CPU: i7 4790k, overclock is stable. Memtest has been run semi-recently as well, nothing catastrophic in the results</p> <p>PSU: ~9 year old Seasonic 750-X Gold 750W, old but CPU manages to remain stable and drives haven&#39;t been dying so it seems to be doing well</p> <p>I do try to keep up to date with updates, even if I&#39;m a bit behind currently (about a week) and the problem has persisted for a while</p> <p>Update: CoreCtrl also causes a consistent crash, see below</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EnderOfGender"> /u/EnderOfGender </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wd5guh/high_gpu_load_consistently_causes_a_crash_without/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wd5guh/high_gpu_load_consistently_causes_a_crash_without/">[comments]</a></span>
