<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently listened to Prokofievâ€™s Sonata No. 6 all the way through, and I really appreciated the clear connection between the first and last movements with the appearance of the same main motif in both. I read that motifs that appear across multiple movements in this way are called head-motifs. Can anyone think of any sonatas/concerti that have head-motifs or that are at least connected in an equally conspicuous way?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/willyj_3"> /u/willyj_3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8tksl/sonatasconcerti_with_headmotifs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8tksl/sonatasconcerti_with_headmotifs/">[comments]</a></span>
