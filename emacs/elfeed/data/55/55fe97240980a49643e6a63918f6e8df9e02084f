So it is set to CLASH with BBL, BPL and CSA. But they will attract the most exciting international players as they have the most investment after IPL. 🇦🇪</p> <p>South Africa will start their franchise T20 league (CSA) again and it&#39;s quite sure that it will begin in January 2023 because they&#39;ve already withdrawn their ODI series against Australia. They gave away vital 30 Super League points despite knowing they are 11th in points table &amp; are in danger of qualifying to the World Cup directly. 🇿🇦</p> <p>Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2023 will begin in February as usual and end in March. After their huge hit last season, it is expected to be bigger and better this time. 🇵🇰</p> <p>IPL 2023 is most likely to take place from March to May 2023 - BCCI have already informed that it will be a two-month tournament and no international cricket will be played in this period. 🇮🇳</p> <p>Later in the middle of year - Lanka Premier League (LPL), Caribbean Premier League (CPL), The Hundred, The 6IXTY and the T10 League will also be played in 2023. 🇱🇰🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🌴</p> </blockquote> <p>Credit : Saif Hasan</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/susmithhh"> /u/susmithhh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/vzhz48/is_2023_the_year_when_international_cricket/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/vzhz48/is_2023_the_year_when_international_cricket/">[comments]</a></span>
