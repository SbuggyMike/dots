<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I found out recently, as I&#39;m looking for a new display, that HDMI2.1 doesn&#39;t support Linux -- as mentioned in this <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417">issue tracker</a> and this <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/HDMI-Closed-Spec-Hurts-Open">Phoronix article</a>. What&#39;s more, this isn&#39;t blocked by any technical issue, but by <strong>legal</strong> issues, because the HDMI forum has blocked any open source implementation of HDMI2.1 drivers. This means HDMI2.1 will not work on Linux until: the patent expires, the law changes, or the HDMI forum changes their minds.</p> <p>So, HDMI sucks. What can we do about it?</p> <ul> <li>Petition? Unlikely to succeed unless some big players in industry get involved.</li> <li>Boycott products with HDMI? Could be effective if enough people commit to it, but that means committing to not buying a TV for a quite a while.</li> <li>Lobby for legislation that would help prevent private interests from stymieing development of public, open projects?</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/silentstorm128"> /u/silentstorm128 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wg731e/hdmi_sucks_what_can_we_do_about_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wg731e/hdmi_sucks_what_can_we_do_about_it/">[comments]</a></span>
