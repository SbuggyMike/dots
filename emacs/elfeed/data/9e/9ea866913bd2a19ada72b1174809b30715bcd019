<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>TL; DR</strong> - would you install Arch on HTPC (home theater PC) that is going to be used mostly on weekends?</p> <p>Hi! I&#39;m using Arch for 12+ months now, on my main laptop, and on my Surface Go. I have used Ubuntu derivatives as my daily driver for 8+ years before that, and I don&#39;t regret my decision to migrate to Arch one bit (AUR!!!).</p> <p>Recently I have purchased a second hand HP EliteDesk 705 Desktop Mini. This PC is going to be connected to my 65&quot; 4K TV, and I&#39;m going to use it to watch movies on weekends, and maybe for some light gaming.</p> <p>The question is - which distro do I install on the box? I don&#39;t consider keeping Windows 10, of course.</p> <p>I really like Arch, and I want to use it on this PC as well, but as a rolling distro, it does require (semi) regular updating. As I have mentioned, I&#39;m going to mostly use the box on Saturdays and Sundays. Considering this, would you install Arch on this machine? Or would you go for something else, a distro that can live for months without updates?</p> <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, updates are (generally) a good thing - we&#39;re not talking about Windows here, but I&#39;m not sure I can find the diligence to run <code>pacman -Syu</code> every weekend. Wouldn&#39;t want to find a system that broke because I kept forgetting to update it..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zdrobot"> /u/Zdrobot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/130hrz7/arch_for_htpc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/130hrz7/arch_for_htpc/">[comments]</a></span>
