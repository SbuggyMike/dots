<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>I&#39;m not a web-developer, but I occasionally use emacs for writing HTML. I&#39;ve been far from memorizing the tags and attributes in HTML - with programming languages, I don&#39;t memorize the parameter list :/. So, I usually have an idea of what I want to do in HTML, but need to resort to googling/duckduckgo-ing quite frequently.</p> <p>However, I felt, it would be pretty great if there were some mode / emacs-extension / some-eww-friendly-website that could provide the tags, and the attributes that each tag takes, may be along with small examples as well as &quot;see also&quot;. I&#39;ve tried <code>company-web</code> and <code>lsp-mode</code>, and both provide descriptions of tags (which I mostly don&#39;t need!) but don&#39;t provide the attributes. With other languages, it is a great help to see the parameter list in the echo area, or even the function/macro/keyword documentation with a simple command.</p> <p>So, if anyone knows about this, it&#39;d be great!</p> <p>Thanks you!</p> <p>EDIT: Moments after I posted this, yasnippet struck me; and it is helpful, but the tag-attribute reference manual would still be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/digikar"> /u/digikar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3msvr/html_tags_and_attributes_reference_manual_cheat/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w3msvr/html_tags_and_attributes_reference_manual_cheat/">[comments]</a></span>
