We&#39;re Albera, a research engine that aims to save users a bunch of time and effort when trying to learn online.</p> <p>Using AI, Albera generates learning roadmaps on any topic (like the one above on <a href="https://app.albera.com/u/alberatrees/arch-linux/">Arch Linux</a>), which are then populated with free resources (articles, courses, videos, blog posts, etc), allowing for a structured, efficient, and distraction-free learning experience.</p> <p>We&#39;ve recently launched an <a href="https://apple.co/3OtNqGi">iOS app</a>, and we&#39;re hoping you guys can try it out and share your thoughts with us (using the platform and the app also helps train the AI to provide better results). Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/albera_com"> /u/albera_com </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7t5ph/an_aipowered_research_tool_for_learning_about_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7t5ph/an_aipowered_research_tool_for_learning_about_and/">[comments]</a></span>
