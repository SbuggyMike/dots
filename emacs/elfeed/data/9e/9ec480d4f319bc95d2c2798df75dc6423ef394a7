<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone know of any ebook reader that allows for adding notes in books which would be usable with org-mode? The way I would image a PERFECT solution would be an open machine with Emacs, where e-books are opened via something like nov.el and notes are added as org-docs with reference to a book position. I don&#39;t think anything allows for this (fingers crossed for Pine Note!).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/msapka"> /u/msapka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12zfrdt/ebook_reader_with_org_mode_sync/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12zfrdt/ebook_reader_with_org_mode_sync/">[comments]</a></span>
