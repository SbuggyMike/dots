<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m trying to boot arch Linux off of a bootable usb on a ROG Strix G17 w/ ryzen 7 4800h and nvidea 3060 mobile. Using the x86_64 version of the arch iso, whenever I boot into the usb I get something along the lines of “nouveau failed to idle channel 0,” then repeated messages of something with a bunch of f’s in it (sorry, don’t have a great memory and am not with my computer rn to check). I’ve not run any commands, this is a 100% fresh install of arch. If it matters windows is also on the hard drive but I was planning to wipe it anyways. If anyone could help that would be lovely.
