<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g8_3avJs3o">really uncommon symphony</a> by Louis Spohr is divided up as follows : 1 - Baroque age - Bach and Handel 2 - Classical age - Haydn and Mozart 3 - Transitional age - Beethoven 4 - Modern age - Romantic Spohr was a rough contemporary of Beethoven and was very aware how music had changed in the 100 years or so before his time. As a result he wrote this symphony to try and capture that change of style. The movements are to be heard in chronological order with each one epitomising the style of each of the ages he is trying to characterise. Was this a successful experiment? Well probably not, but the music is nevertheless pleasant and engaging and it is obvious from the third movement how much he admired (and tried to copy) Beethoven. The fourth movement is interesting in that it was his view of &quot;state of the art&quot; romantic music of his time. Of course he had no idea of what was to follow! Spohr is a fascinating composer who sat astride the classical- romantic transition. He wrote nine symphonies in all and many concertos and chamber works, His best known work is probably the &quot;Nonet&quot; which really is something that everyone should know - it is a charming and tuneful work. &quot;Charming and tuneful&quot; is probably the best and worst you cans say about Spohr. All his music is enjoyable and really nice to listen to. But there is no &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;, nothing deep or profound, no tortured souls -‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­just really nice music by a very competent composer. Mendelssohn was a great fan.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The9thHuman"> /u/The9thHuman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wg8f46/spohrs_6th_symphony_has_one_movement_for_each/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wg8f46/spohrs_6th_symphony_has_one_movement_for_each/">[comments]</a></span>
