<p>We're building an app that helps people manage their schedule, tasks and notes all in one place.<p>The goal is to create a workspace, where people can manage their various priorities, both personal and professional, see a single schedule combined of all their calendars and manage their days without switching between multiple apps.<p>At the moment we've implemented Google calendar synchronisation, basic tasks and notes. Also Emery has some things we really wanted to see in other apps â€“ private notes for meetings, categories that can be used to group tasks/notes/meetings together, weekly productivity reports.<p>Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!</p>
