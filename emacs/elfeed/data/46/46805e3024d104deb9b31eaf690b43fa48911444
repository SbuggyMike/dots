<p>The installation medium now provides a guided <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/archinstall/">installer</a>.</p>
<p>This addition to the default method of installation (based on the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">installation guide</a>) is similar to the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Installation_process">other methods</a>.</p>
<p>If you use this installer, do not forget to mention it when asking for support and also to provide the archinstall log, when asked.</p>
