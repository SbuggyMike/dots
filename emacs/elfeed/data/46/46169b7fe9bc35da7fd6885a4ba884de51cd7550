<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As of <code>archlinux-keyring 20220713-2</code>, the dependency tree has changed slightly. The package used to be required by <code>pacman</code>, but that&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/commit/f7a67eb37d99f5de10fd98feab98011ce4a8504d">changed with this commit</a>.</p> <p>See that commit message for details, but basically that dependency relationship has been reversed, and now <code>archlinux-keyring</code> requires <code>pacman</code>. It was also added to the <code>base-devel</code> group so that on new installs, it comes in explicitly.</p> <p><strong>For most people, this will probably pass without note.</strong> <em>However</em>, if you&#39;re like me and your update script removes package orphans after an install, it&#39;ll attempt to remove <code>archlinux-keyring</code> as an orphan. This is because it was installed as a dependency for <code>pacman</code>, but that relationship doesn&#39;t exist anymore.</p> <p>Needless to say, uninstalling <code>archlinux-keyring</code> would be a Bad Move (tm). If you find yourself in this situation and don&#39;t want to accidentally uninstall that package, make sure to mark it as explicitly installed with <code>pacman -D --asexplicit archlinux-keyring</code>. This will imitate the new behavior on new installs, which will have it as explicitly installed when you install the <code>base-devel</code> group.</p> <p><strong>EDIT</strong> if your installation is newer than October 2019, you probably have the <code>base</code> package and won&#39;t have this problem. If you installed before then, and DIDN&#39;T install the <code>base</code> package when it came out, you might hit this issue</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/heylookmatt"> /u/heylookmatt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w9eozd/psa_archlinuxkeyring_dependency_tree_changed_dont/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w9eozd/psa_archlinuxkeyring_dependency_tree_changed_dont/">[comments]</a></span>
