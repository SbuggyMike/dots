Roughly 3 months later, On 13th Feb 2018, She made her debut for India against South Africa in a T20I game,scoring 37 off 27 in a successful chase of 165. Her ODI debut against Australia wasn&#39;t as successful with her scoring just a solitary run.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>What do the stats say? :</strong></li> </ul> <p>In 56 T20Is, Rodrigues has scored 1196 runs at an average of 28.47 and SR of 111 with 7 fifties and a best of 72, boasting of being the youngest ever to get to 1000 T20I runs and 2nd fastest Indian to the same after Mithali Raj and 8th fastest overall.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/eus65l78a1g91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1863701ab1c5917afb0b577da0016421705585ba">https://preview.redd.it/eus65l78a1g91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1863701ab1c5917afb0b577da0016421705585ba</a></p> <p>Her ODI record though, has not being that great as she has only scored 394 runs in 21 games @ 19.7 and a SR of 68 with 3 50+ scores and an alarmingly high number of ducks(6). </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Through the years :</strong></li> </ul> <p>Even though, ODIs has been a tough nut to crack for her to crack, she did have a decent 2019 in the ODI as she scored 327 runs in 12 innings including her best 81 in a match winning partnership with Smriti Mandhana against NZ.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/crzjbllzf1g91.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=236a726820da8f3dec96cfb4f8f1a138c76406ba">https://preview.redd.it/crzjbllzf1g91.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=236a726820da8f3dec96cfb4f8f1a138c76406ba</a></p> <p>T20Is on the other hand have been great for her as she has averaged 25+ in 4 out of the 5 years even though the SR still remains a concern.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/hbh75643g1g91.png?width=1367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50056a9693d1ef9d0fe07d7dc2850e068bd26262">https://preview.redd.it/hbh75643g1g91.png?width=1367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50056a9693d1ef9d0fe07d7dc2850e068bd26262</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>T20 Adventures:</strong></li> </ul> <p>in Kia Super League 2019, Rodrigues while playing for Yorkshire Diamonds scored 401 runs in 10 matches averaging 57 with 2 fifties and 1 hundred,being the secind highest run getter in the tournament after Danni Wyatt(466).</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/gyf8f7xle1g91.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e02545adff7b53ec037060e43ec9a89f160bacf">https://preview.redd.it/gyf8f7xle1g91.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e02545adff7b53ec037060e43ec9a89f160bacf</a></p> <p>In the Hundred 2021, She lit up the tournament with a 92 off 43 in a chase of 128 against the Welsh Fire,ultimately ending as the second highest run-getter in the tournament behind DvN with 249 but beating her comprehensively in the SR with a SR of 150 as compared to DvN&#39;s 105.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/jk4n2m4lh1g91.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8c349128a466025d62a0dccb2611077367c43e2">https://preview.redd.it/jk4n2m4lh1g91.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8c349128a466025d62a0dccb2611077367c43e2</a></p> <p>On the same note, She scored 333 runs in 13 innings in the WBBL 2021 while playing for the Melbourne Renegades at an average of 27 and SR of 117<strong>.</strong></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Ups &amp; Downs :</strong></li> </ul> <p>While T20s in general have been her strength, there is a sense of innings building with priority to consistency in her batting. A trait only shown by one other Indian batter that being Harmanpreet Kaur.</p> <p>But despite the same trait being an important aspect of the ODI game, She has often looked at sea in the ODIs, getting out early in the innings and looking shaky more often than not with her defense often being breached rather easily .</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Current, The Future &amp; The Conclusion:</strong></li> </ul> <p>With her still being only 21 and an integral part of the national T20I team, some more chances in the ODIs might not be far off for her but there&#39;s still a long way to go both for her team and herself as a player in order to secure greatness. There&#39;s a lot for the taking and lot to work on and only the future can answer all these questions,especially with the WIPL on the horizon.</p> <p>Let me know what you think of Jemimah Rodrigues and as it ends here&#39;s a picture of Jemi playing her signature late dab.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/14x46tkxh1g91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96b83122762f3e44b8f2f80a677840af6c9661e0">https://preview.redd.it/14x46tkxh1g91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96b83122762f3e44b8f2f80a677840af6c9661e0</a></p> <p><strong>As Always, Cheers, It has been a pleasure.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alittlemoreofbrowny"> /u/alittlemoreofbrowny </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/whhr3p/jemimah_rodrigues_how_fulfilled_is_the_prophecy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/whhr3p/jemimah_rodrigues_how_fulfilled_is_the_prophecy/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
