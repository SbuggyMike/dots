<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know there is a way to edit my grub config to enable silent booting once Arch is installed. Is there a way to silent boot using the live ISO? Or is there a way to prevent delayed boot messages while using the live ISO? </p> <p>I&#39;m writing an install script for myself and while running tests on Virt-Manager, I get delayed boot messages (the [ OK ] ... messages) that get pretty annoying with how random they are. The messages don&#39;t break the script, just annoying to see random boot messages while the script is running.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kantoking0206"> /u/kantoking0206 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wiohqc/how_to_silent_boot_the_official_arch_iso/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wiohqc/how_to_silent_boot_the_official_arch_iso/">[comments]</a></span>
