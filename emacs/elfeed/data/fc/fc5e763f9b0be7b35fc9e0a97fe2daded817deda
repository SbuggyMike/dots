<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a three button mouse. With some programs you can hold the middle button (button 2) and move the mouse around to scroll (instead of using the mouse wheel). Is it possible to configure this in Emacs? I figure the answer is yes, because it&#39;s Emacs, but after a fair amount of searching I haven&#39;t found anything.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chaozprizm"> /u/chaozprizm </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w8ueet/middle_mouse_button_scroll_without_scroll_wheel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w8ueet/middle_mouse_button_scroll_without_scroll_wheel/">[comments]</a></span>
