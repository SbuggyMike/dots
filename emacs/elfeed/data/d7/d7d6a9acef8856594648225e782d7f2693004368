<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the recent squad announcement of the Indian team for the upcoming WTC final it got me thinking that just how many players are rapidly approaching the fag end of their careers at the same time.</p> <p>Rohit Umesh will turn 36 Jadeja Pujara Rahane Kohli 35 and our veteran spinner<br/> Ashwin 37 and pacer Shami 33 Ishant and Saha are already out.</p> <p>For all we know the likes of Pant and Bumrah may never play Test cricket again.</p> <p>And the likes of Bharat and KL don&#39;t really inspire confidence Mayank Vihari may never be picked again.</p> <p>Also someone like Unadkat I feel like the ship has already sailed for him.</p> <p>Also there is a huge step in quality when u consider a competition like Ranji which has become too bloated and bland in recent years not to consider the difference in pitches which are flatliners in domestic cricket but literal dustbowls when it comes to the national teams and forget about overseas where there is practically no comparison.</p> <p>I am afraid that India may go down the NZ way in the upcoming iteration of the ICC Test Championship with the ghosts of the past 2011-12 AUS and 2012-13 ENG coming to haunt us once more when we play against them next year.</p> <p>For all I hope that India do get their hands on the Test mace on this occasion but the chances of that happening also looks bleak.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanAdhesiveness912"> /u/HumanAdhesiveness912 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/133gz5n/a_crisis_looming_over_indian_test_cricket/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/133gz5n/a_crisis_looming_over_indian_test_cricket/">[comments]</a></span>
