<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Solved!</p> <p>Not sure what the source was, but a factory reset on my router seemed to do the trick. This is a hair concerning as I have not had this issue with other devices. Alas, hard to pinpoint if it was my arch at fault or something else.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Hey all! I&#39;m fairly new to Arch and I&#39;m a bit stuck on this one!</p> <p>TLDR: My networking was working yesterday and now it is not; I&#39;m out of places I know where to look.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I began my Arch journey just two days ago, and I&#39;ve had quite a bit of fun with the install process, and relishing in so much more control over everything than Ubuntu. For the most part, the install went pretty smooth! I set up networking from the bootable USB no problem and I was able to figure out every other hangup along the way with some googling and old fashioned troubleshooting.</p> <p>Today I&#39;ve finally began my dive into window managers and desktop environments, and unfortunately, it&#39;s where my problem has began. After trying out the plasma desktop (package desktop-plasma) I subsequently sought to uninstall it, as I&#39;d enjoyed my experience with gnome better. After doing so, I&#39;ve been unable to connect to the internet.</p> <p>Strangely, it seems I am connected to my network, but I have no IP address, and pinging my router yields &#39;connect: Network is unreachable&#39;. The adapter is still visible when running &#39;iwctl device list&#39;.</p> <p>During my install, I was stuck in this same situation, but I found that installing and enabling the dhcpcd service fixed it no problem. However, this time, though it seems all the services I can think of (dhcpcd, NetworkManager, and wpa_supplicant) all seem to be running alright, and yet, no IP. (For what it is worth, I _think_ I have an IPv6 IP if I&#39;m understanding the output of &#39;ip a&#39; correctly.)</p> <p>Regardless, I&#39;m not expecting a magic one-liner to fix it all, but I&#39;m curious if you guys have any thoughts where I should look to troubleshoot this.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: Goofy typos</p> <p>So a couple updates:</p> <p>- I am now using just iwd and dhcpcd for connectivity with the same result.</p> <p>- I checked my router configuration from another PC, and it claims to see my computer connected with, both an IPv4 and IPv6 address, even though &#39;ip a&#39; only shows an IPv6 address.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Drayux"> /u/Drayux </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wjore7/struggling_with_networking_on_new_install/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wjore7/struggling_with_networking_on_new_install/">[comments]</a></span>
