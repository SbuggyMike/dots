<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been possess this issue ever since I switched to emacs28 with native comp. If I try to open a file directly in the terminal version of emacs (e.g. <code>emacs -nw filename</code>), emacs won&#39;t open the file -- instead I get an error message saying: <code>Symbol’s value as variable is void: \213</code>, and a blank buffer. As far as I can tell, emacs works normally after that, and I can open the file with <code>C-x C-f</code> but it&#39;s a bit of an annoyance. The <code>--debug-init</code> option gives no additional output. This only happens with the -nw option. The gui works normally. Anybody know what&#39;s going on here? PS: I&#39;m on MacOS and using the emacs-plus distribution from Homebrew. <strong>EDIT</strong>: After some investigation it turns out the following code inside my <code>init.el</code> file was the issue: (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist) (setq file-name-handler-alist nil) (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist () (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)) (add-hook &#39;emacs-startup-hook &#39;startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist) Anybody know why this‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­would cause the error on emacs28?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/baby_vip"> /u/baby_vip </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w4sj1j/cant_open_file_directly_in_terminal_with_native/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w4sj1j/cant_open_file_directly_in_terminal_with_native/">[comments]</a></span>
