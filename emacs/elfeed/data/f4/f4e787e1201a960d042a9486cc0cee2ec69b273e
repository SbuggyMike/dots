<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I main the scotch gambit as white which leads to very fun and imbalanced attacking games, but as black I find it hard to generate wins. I usually play the caro or Slav which leads to solid games that are a bit too slow for me and lead to draws quite often. Does anyone have recommendations for a sharper response against e4 and d4 that leads to more winning chances as black?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ArenSic"> /u/ArenSic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wjt22v/sharp_openings_for_black/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wjt22v/sharp_openings_for_black/">[comments]</a></span>
