<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy! I&#39;m trying to get my computers to where they&#39;ll all seamlessly synchronize all my files between them, mostly my PKMS files. I&#39;m quite new to Emacs and I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m making a mistake here.</p> <p>I have a directory `~/kb/~ which contains all of my notes. Yesterday I set up Syncthing to synchronize that folder between all of my computers. Eventually I&#39;d like for changed files to auto-reload in Emacs if they&#39;re open in a buffer, but for now I&#39;m fine with just synchronizing them and manually reopening them.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the relevant bit of my <code>init.el</code> <code> (use-package org-roam :custom (org-roam-directory (file-truename &quot;~/kb&quot;)) (org-roam-db-location (concat org-roam-directory &quot;/org-roam.db&quot;))) </code> As you can see, <code>org-roam.db</code> is stored in <code>~/kb</code>, which is synchronized. I&#39;m wondering if this will have any adverse affects?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tristan401"> /u/Tristan401 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13is9po/is_it_a_bad_idea_to_share_the_same_orgroamdb/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13is9po/is_it_a_bad_idea_to_share_the_same_orgroamdb/">[comments]</a></span>
