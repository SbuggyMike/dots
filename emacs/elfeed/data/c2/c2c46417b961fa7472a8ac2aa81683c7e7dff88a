<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Genuine question. I know Vertico is already pretty close to built-in (uses many built-in emacs features unlike Helm) but I&#39;d like what they can do when compared to fido-vertical-mode.</p> <p>I tried installing Vertico and consult but I just can&#39;t appreciate their additional features. What am I missing? I know they are powerful tools and I&#39;d like to know what am i missing. </p> <p>I also know that maybe i do not really need them if i can&#39;t see their value, but I&#39;m keen to know their strengths.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cidra_"> /u/cidra_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138vrvf/why_use_verticoconsult_if_i_can_just_use/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138vrvf/why_use_verticoconsult_if_i_can_just_use/">[comments]</a></span>
