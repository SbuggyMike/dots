<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The mephisto waltzes, the transcendental etudes, reminiscences of don Juan, his piano concertos....I just adore them! Mephisto in particular I&#39;ve been listening to a lot lately, it has this perfect mixture of aggressive discordant and sadness of a suffering soul crying our for help, while still being bouncy and light at times that just makes my heart throb.</p> <p>I really like virtuouso pieces, they&#39;re often far more immersive and impactful for me and kinda sweep me up in the chaos of it all. It just boils forth such a vindicating feeling, sometimes anger and sometimes joy, but in such a way that I end up listening to them again and again and again just to appreciate the genius of these works of music.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sausage_fingies"> /u/Sausage_fingies </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/131hd24/i_dont_know_if_this_is_necessarily_an_unpopular/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/131hd24/i_dont_know_if_this_is_necessarily_an_unpopular/">[comments]</a></span>
