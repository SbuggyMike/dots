Besides his excellent opening choices (which provide the structures and ideas of a good endgame) and his superb middlegame plans (which help him to gain decisive material or attacking chances), when it comes to an endgame with any imbalance, he manages to create art on the board. </p> <p>Sometimes the position is just easy to draw, and it is a stale position with no imbalances, then usually he walks off with a draw (note that only half of his draws are in the endgame). However, when it comes to an exciting position with imbalances like an exchange, or 2 rooks for a queen, or 4 pawns for a knight and a pawn, he can create magic because he plays a practical intuitive game. </p> <p>He makes sure to be the one in the driving seat and play comfortable positions where his opponent has to struggle thanks to the tempi won in his great middlegames, so once these equal but imbalanced endgames arise, he knows what to do. </p> <p>These endgames are even equal according to stockfish, but once the depth gets a bit higher it starts to lean towards Magnus, however, most of the time they are equal positions but remember chess is a mind game, so he is happy to crush his opponent&#39;s mind as humans are not computers after several hours of exhausting chess.</p> <ol> <li>Magnus Carlsen vs Georg Meier (1-0) Olympiad 2022.</li> </ol> <p><a href="https://i.redd.it/q0r15lktkre91.gif">In this position, Magnus has the white pieces and has just played 78.Qf5</a></p> <p>Up until now, black has been checking the king and white has slowly been moving his pieces up. This looks to be better for white but it is actually a draw as all black needs to do is guard the g7 square with his Qc7 and play Kh7, Kh8 and there will be no mate thanks to the king being in the corner. </p> <p>But with such little time from his opponent and the stress of the position, black thought all he had to do was keep checking since it was working till now and he would have a stalemate right? </p> <p>Wrong, as after Qe3+, Qf4, Qc5+, and Kg6, black resigned as Magnus Carlsen&#39;s king is too close to the opponent king and mate is inevitable. An example is Qc2+, Qf5, and any check will result in a trade of queens. </p> <p>Somehow Magnus forced his opponent into a position where he only had one good move.</p> <p>2 other great examples of this were:</p> <ol> <li> <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=2318022">Veselin Topalov 0-1 Magnus Carlsen: SuperUnited Croatia (2022)</a> White played 63.Ra7?? this blunders to e5!, fxe5, and Kg6! Black will win the pawns and white will be in zugzwang. White had to play Ra6 (to cut the king from the 6th rank) or Ra8 (to check the king and defend the g file).</li> <li><a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=2127373">Magnus Carlsen 1-0 Ian Nepomniachtchi: World Championship Match (2021)</a> In the legendary game 6 classic, Black played 136...Qe6?? a logical-looking move, to pin the rook and then keep checking but after Kh4, black&#39;s checks were blocked by whites pieces, and all together they slowly moved up until Nepo resigned. Black had to keep his queen on the b1 to h7 diagonal with Qb1 or Qc2. That way the queen needs to attack the white king from behind, this is a draw because, after Rf6, Qd1 and Qf3 are threatened. not allowing the king to move up, and that way white pieces are forced to defend the king.</li> </ol> <p>Thanks for reading and have fun watching the Olympiad and Magnus Carlsen!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Speedy_Cyclone"> /u/Speedy_Cyclone </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wc6z2h/the_best_endgame_technique_ever_magnus_carlsen/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wc6z2h/the_best_endgame_technique_ever_magnus_carlsen/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
