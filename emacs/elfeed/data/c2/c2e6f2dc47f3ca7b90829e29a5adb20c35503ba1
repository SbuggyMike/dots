<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I appreciate that this is very much a niche question, but anyway ... I&#39;m trying to install a jupyter kernel for the mathematics package FriCAS; this kernel is called jfricas and instructions for installing it (using Ubuntu) are <a href="https://jfricas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">here</a>. It seems to require a lisp webserver called &quot;cl-hunchentoot&quot; which I can&#39;t find anywhere in the ArchLinux repositories, including the AUR. If anybody has any ideas how I might proceed, I&#39;d be very grateful! Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/amca01"> /u/amca01 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbnd2n/installing_the_lisp_webserver_hunchentoot/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wbnd2n/installing_the_lisp_webserver_hunchentoot/">[comments]</a></span>
