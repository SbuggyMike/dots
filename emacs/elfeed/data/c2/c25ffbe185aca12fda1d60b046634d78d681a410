<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So basically if i try to do sudo su or literally any sudo command it says the password is wrong. But i know im typing in the right password and that its correct, i even followed this <a href="https://youtu.be/hnR3rkXev50">tutorial</a> and used the second method. I rebooted and still it just says wrong password. Does anyone have any clue what could be happening?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sigillum_Dei"> /u/Sigillum_Dei </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w80izl/cant_do_sudo_password_doesnt_work/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w80izl/cant_do_sudo_password_doesnt_work/">[comments]</a></span>
