<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good afternoon everyone, welcome to another Piece of the Week. Last week, we listened to Dohnanyi&#39;s sextet, feel free to check that piece out if you haven&#39;t heard before.</p> <p>our next Piece of the Week is <strong>Claudio Monteverdi&#39;s Madrigal &quot;Hor che&#39;l ciel e la terra&quot; (c.1638)</strong></p> <p><strong><a href="http://vmirror.imslp.org/files/imglnks/usimg/c/c5/IMSLP493599-PMLP532923-Monteverdi_-_Hor_Che_&#x27;l_Ciel_e_la_Terra.pdf">score from IMSLP</a></strong></p> <p>some listening notes from <a href="https://www.sonomabach.org/hor-chel-ciel---monteverdi.html">the blog Sonoma Bach</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Start not with the recording, but rather with the text/translation and with Cinzia&#39;s pronunciation guide. Settle into the language and the poetic intention--just as Monteverdi would have done before sitting down to create his setting. Notice all the images from nature; the opposing pairs (night and day; war and peace; sweet and bitter; life and death); the rapid change from nocturne to bright battle; the paradox of both solace and torment coming from the same source.</p> <p>Imagine what you might do with all this if you were a composer--where would you put fast notes, slow notes, comfortable or dissonant harmonies, soloistic or ensemble passages? How would you structure your music around this powerful poem? How and where would you apply Monteverdi&#39;s three styles noted above?</p> <p>And then: Take a look! Take a listen! Learn at the master&#39;s feet!</p> <p>You will be awestruck and inspired by his rendering of the unforgettable opening scene of nocturnal (but foreboding) peace; by his introduction into this scene of outcries of distress; by the sudden eruption of the full-blown &#39;warlike style&#39;; by his painting of the &#39;bright and living fountain&#39;; and by his moving depiction of the lover&#39;s fate of being condemned to an eternal samsara of birth and of death, ever &#39;so distant from salvation&#39;.</p> <p>Monteverdi uses a six-voice texture for the piece, plus two violins and basso continuo. He constantly varies the texture from tutti to solo voice, from duets to answering trios. And, of course, the style (as defined in Monteverdi&#39;s preface) varies throughout--&#39;temperate&#39;; &#39;languid&#39;; &#39;warlike&#39;--as required by Petrarch&#39;s poem: The words as the mistress of the music.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ways to Listen</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5E1piv-NHs">YouTube - Concerto Italiano</a>, includes score</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye3F_q2PWXo">YouTube - Les Cris de Paris</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMxV4TbA8sM">YouTube - TENENT vocal artists</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/24P2eD75jIo5VSdXParSya?si=adbe106531234416">Spotify - Jordi Savall, Montserrat Figueras, Hesp√®rion XX</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0hwhgsfKobm1bYlcLc0lDg?si=55360b218266448d">Spotify - The Monteverdi Choir</a></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Discussion Prompts</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>What are your favorite parts or moments in this work?
