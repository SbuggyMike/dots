<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve followed exactly the instructions here:<a href="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/rust-emacs-setup/">https://robert.kra.hn/posts/rust-emacs-setup/</a></p> <p>I get an initial error that workspace isn&#39;t found, but this goes away after a few seconds loading. Then any time I run a command with rustic it complains I don&#39;t have cargo, but I can run all cargo commands fine in command line, or using M-x cargo-run etc.</p> <p>Also when I try to use any snippet, it says company-capf cant use yasnippet. Setting the yas global mode does not fix this either. </p> <p>So all in all, my attempts to use rust in emacs have been pretty horrible. Is this tutorial just very out of date, or is there a better example setup I could be looking at?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chiathrowaway123"> /u/chiathrowaway123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w66woa/trying_to_setup_a_rust_environment_rustic_keeps/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w66woa/trying_to_setup_a_rust_environment_rustic_keeps/">[comments]</a></span>
