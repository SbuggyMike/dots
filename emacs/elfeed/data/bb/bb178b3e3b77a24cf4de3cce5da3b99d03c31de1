<p>The <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/php/">php</a> packages have been updated to the latest version 8.2. In
addition to this, a new set of <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/php-legacy/">php-legacy</a> packages have been
introduced. These will follow the oldest but still <a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php">actively supported
PHP</a> branch. This enables users to install the latest version but also
introduces the option to use third party applications that might rely
on an older version. Both branches will be kept up to date following
our rolling release model. <code>php</code> and <code>php-legacy</code> can be installed at the
same time as the latter uses a <code>-legacy</code> suffix for its binaries and
configuration files.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the <a href="https://archlinux.org/news/php-80-and-php-7-legacy-packages-are-available/">php7</a> packages have been removed as they
reached end of life. The <code>imap</code> extension will no longer be provided as
it relies on the <code>c-client</code> library which has been abandoned for many
years.</p>
