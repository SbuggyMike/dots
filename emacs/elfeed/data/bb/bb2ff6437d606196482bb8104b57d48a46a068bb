<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently using it for most of my browsing, so far it&#39;s GREAT! Only available on LINUX. Flaws are - slow loading of pages (i am ok with slow things as i own potato), no smooth scrolling and autoscrolling, not customizable (new tab icon should be placed just like firefox), too much integration with GNOME (minimize and maximise are useless on tiling wm), etc. The main thing is - it uses its own web engine! Is anyone else using it?
