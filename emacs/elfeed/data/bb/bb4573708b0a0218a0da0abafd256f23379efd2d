Let&#39;s review his test batting and compare 2021 VK and 2022 VK. I feel like some of this subreddit is being over reactionary over his poor form. I agree he hasn&#39;t done well in the T20&#39;s and has recently started to fail in ODI&#39;s, but his test game is better. </p> <p>2021 Virat Kohli</p> <p>Virat Kohli started his 2021 with at mediocre test series against ENG, with two ducks and two scores in the 10&#39;s. However he did show glimpse of the old Virat with two gritty fifties both in Chennai, where he showed a lot of discipline against the spin bowlers. </p> <p>The annual WTC Final was against IND vs NZ, was going to be difficult for India, as they are remembered for their inability to play quality swing bowling, and since it was overcast conditions it was proving to be most difficult for the Indian team. However Kohli showed how to played swing bowling and was very disciplined in his innings managing a 93 percent control. The feet at middle stump </p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/uaicei1l9zb91.png?width=1698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d41eec887e4857c98c610f5fafe1e09071a3588">Perfect, his head position is great, his feet is at middle stump, which allows good judgement against swing, and he his outside his crease, overall his 2018 technique. </a></p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/umbcdnspbzb91.png?width=2536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5418c246f24bb58b3c7bf4f612b039b8ad523b93">Look at his feet, his feet is not far across offstump, and he has good judgement of the ball. </a></p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/0htwqmd5czb91.png?width=2542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=561b328aab0250c11d8f35b3941dc8618d498256">Shot</a></p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/cbpoaumndzb91.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d08ea43bab7cd838a13b65e3a61fd02f99e7a26">His ability to play the ball late was being praised by Ian Bishop</a></p> <p>Now Jamieson had got Kohli out with an inswinger, and in the second innings he kept teasing Kohli by bowling inswingers, and then Kohli reverted to his 2014 technique where he on quote said &quot;I was expecting the inswinger too much, and that opened up my hip a lot more, what should have been done. I kept looking for the inswinger and I was in no position to counter the outswinger&quot;</p> <p>Jamieson teased Kohli with the outswinger, and Kohli went fishing outside offstump with the faulty technique. This anomaly continued throughout the ENG series. This is where is problem got technical, and he was repeating the same mistakes. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/k8rtantpezb91.png?width=1336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5adf9f704247b1677a996d97bb5b58ad86ffb94a">https://preview.redd.it/k8rtantpezb91.png?width=1336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5adf9f704247b1677a996d97bb5b58ad86ffb94a</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/2djapdyrezb91.png?width=1330&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbad858ee6eb7a2bef5f82147478cf1ad395170a">Compare his foot position to the one where he drove Southee above, notice how his feet is far across outside off stump, this allows him to nick the ball outside offstump </a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/zja191i2fzb91.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5f88f87efe66f3060202e002e32e813377e18b1">https://preview.redd.it/zja191i2fzb91.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5f88f87efe66f3060202e002e32e813377e18b1</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ncvinjf4fzb91.png?width=1336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb892569f8c299d38d58aa72004330f5b9a439e0">Terrible judgement of the ball, his feet is so far across offstump, such an ugly dismissal. </a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/4772qrijfzb91.png?width=1574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c42071227dce66129d0c1a6c13778c27e5a336eb">This was even worse than the last dismissal! His foot position is so bad, just terrible to watch. </a></p> <p>2022 Koach</p> <p>Now Kohli did change his technique under Dravid&#39;s maiden overseas test match as a coach. He was far more defensive and made a very gritty innnings while under pressure. </p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/nki9c88ckzb91.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a996cf9b8dc27045478ef0e7055c2d74992b3e62">Look the foot is back at middle stump! He has reverted back to his 2018 technique</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ig1rop6llzb91.png?width=1554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29da7e1aea90a33e13e782f74116c0762088d1b6">Feet on middle stump, good judgement of the ball</a></p> <p>So everyone was really happy, and believed with this newly revived defensive technique, he could thrive overseas, but he didn&#39;t stop then, he made more changes to his technique, in a county match against Leicester. </p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/zmnejgculzb91.png?width=1340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05d92b7dcb80988a505fea6f6a9da5bc54f32896">Showing all three stumps, to ensure his foot would not go far across offstump, and his trigger were very minimal, which was a surprise, as his triggers are normally flashy. </a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/lf8vccc8mzb91.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d99472cbbbe31461d2c73a49436fda5c4ad4e20">All three stumps are shown</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/gs318nfamzb91.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14b192702af511182dc9245eee0540e61aba2ee5">This new technique disables him to reach far across outside offstump, and allow better judgement of the ball, far superior than his 2018 technique, this technique is very similar to KL Rahul&#39;s technique who had done well in ENG with his technique</a></p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/zza24smjmzb91.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d083aadfbde4e22249835a90209cf00f1ebab834">https://preview.redd.it/zza24smjmzb91.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d083aadfbde4e22249835a90209cf00f1ebab834</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/985c65glmzb91.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d657820ba211d62f920c60eec93e2b7fe82a9732">https://preview.redd.it/985c65glmzb91.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d657820ba211d62f920c60eec93e2b7fe82a9732</a></p> <p>In the ENG tour of 2021, his release shots were mainly the flick and drive. The English knew better to bowl, to the pads of any sub-continent batter, and hence targeted the outside-off stump line, where Kohli could only drive the deliveries, or defend which resulted in edges. Taking a page from Rahul&#39;s textbook, he backs himself far in the leg-stump, the trigger movement, will bring his foot to middle-stump, and allow better judgement and timing of the ball. Let&#39;s see his batting in the ENG tour of 2022. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/pc6x0a01nzb91.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fe55fde1d9025c9029efd0fdfbdfea0713d377c">He is showing all three of his stumps, which is good sign, that is noticing that his far technical sound with this technique</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/nqanfek9nzb91.png?width=1554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c79911cb5e812bcf1a4300b38da5993ef7e3281">How is he going to fare against James Anderson?</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/b5geqcaenzb91.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd1450166126ea4adb07eefdb6fbd05184a9a1be">This is great to see from Virat Kohli, his head position is great, his feet position is back on middle stump. </a></p> <p>Though he failed in this test match, it is fair to say, his dismissals were rather unlucky, him trying to leave the ball, and getting an inside edge, and that extra bounce Stokes extracted from the pitch, whre Pope dropped it, and Root took a one-hander. In 2021 his technique was heavily flawed, but his problem in 2022 is just his luck, he hasn&#39;t done anything wrong with his technique. His test game is great, but his problems in T20 and ODI are rather concerning, I&#39;m defending Kohli&#39;s test game, I feel like there is still some hunger in the lion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Plebeian_Citizen"> /u/Plebeian_Citizen </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w0xjuf/why_its_not_the_time_to_give_up_on_virat_kohli/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w0xjuf/why_its_not_the_time_to_give_up_on_virat_kohli/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
