<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have relatively new laptop from lenovo and decided to try linux and dual boot it with windows. But after a few weeks, I started getting a message about the cmos battery going bad and after a coupe of more uses the laptop got stuck on tablet mode, so I can no longer use the keyboard. Is there any bios solutions or a way on how to reset the cmos battery to fix the issue? I remember from a video I watched a long time ago that linux does something different with the cmos battery compared to windows and I was wondering if that could be the issue.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ichikadon"> /u/Ichikadon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3z7o1/does_linux_do_anything_with_windows_laptop_cmos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3z7o1/does_linux_do_anything_with_windows_laptop_cmos/">[comments]</a></span>
