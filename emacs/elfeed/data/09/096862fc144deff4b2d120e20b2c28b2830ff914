<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>for some time I&#39;ve been looking for an alternative for Linux mint, with which I&#39;ve always been very comfortable, especially focused on stability and having KDE as DE, in this way I discovered MX Linux.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried it on a virtual machine and it seems pretty well organized and in line with my needs (especially I really appreciated that it was Debian-based but didn&#39;t require all those initial configurations) however I have some concerns about the security of this OS.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>In particular I was left really very confused by the Distrowatch affair, as MX Linux for all intents and purposes is a fairly niche distro but apparently on this site it appears to be in the first I can among the most used.</p> <p>I am well aware that this site&#39;s popularity is based solely on how much the distro is searched, but I find it quite strange that possibly fanboys have searched this distro so much so that it prevails in the polls, while I am getting the suspicion that perhaps the creators of the distro themselves have used some bot to make themselves more visible, but at this point it would all seem quite controversial to me.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Also looking for information regarding the makers of MX Linux, I can&#39;t find clear informations.</p> <p>Sometimes they talk about a dedicated group of programmers, but other times it seems that this distro is run by 1/2 people, without even revealing their identities and thus making it all quite uncredible again to me.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Since I am looking for an OS for my Laptop and my daly use, I would like security to come first and my privacy and personal data to be protected.</p> <p>This whole thing is making me quite hesitant because in my eyes MX Linux is a very good and performing distro, but at the same time quite controversial and I don&#39;t know if it deserves trust or not.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>What do you guys think about it ? </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I would really appreciate if someone who has some information regarding security and the creators of MX Linux could share it, so that I can be able to figure out whether to trust it or not.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I thank in advance those who will help me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AvatarQwerty"> /u/AvatarQwerty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3ff6k/is_mx_linux_a_trustworthy_distro/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3ff6k/is_mx_linux_a_trustworthy_distro/">[comments]</a></span>
