<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let’s start this by stating what should be the obvious: this is not Zak Crawleys fault. He is out of form, he may, quite simply, just not be good enough but either way, it is not his fault and he has endured and absolute torrent of abuse over the past few months which he is completely undeserving of.(not necessarily here because I think the majority of us are better than that..)</p> <p>Now, I’ve never played international cricket or cricket at any level where you could ever pretend there was pressure but I assume the position Zak Crawley is in right now must feel horrible. </p> <p>The runs aren’t coming for England, they’re not coming for Kent. Watching him bat recently you feel he could go back and play some pub cricket and the runs still wouldn’t come. So why is he still being picked?</p> <p>With every innings the runs don’t come, the pressure ramps up on him, with every innings the runs don’t come, the further away the next runs feel, all those feelings and doubts magnify in your mind, the calls to be dropped get louder and more unavoidable.</p> <p>By continuing to pick him, however much they may feel they’re being positive and backing him and filling him full of confidence, the England selectors, the coach and the captain are failing Zak Crawley. They’re opening him up to more abuse, to more pressure, to more of everything that comes with top level cricket. He needs to be taken out of the firing line for his own good and the good of his career long term.</p> <p>I relate it slightly to Haseeb Hameed. He went to India, scored some runs and became the messiah, the next decade of English cricket was suddenly on his shoulders, then he broke his thumb and his form collapsed. The pressure coming back that he’d just slot back in and everything would be brilliant ramped up, England sent Mark Ramprakash up to net with him on a weekly basis, singling him out as ‘the chosen one’ and in the end, it took him years and a move to a new county to recover.</p> <p>They risk this happening to Zak Crawley. There is no doubt the kid has talent but you can’t just keep throwing him out there, telling him to go hard at the ball and be positive and then saying everything will be fine, he’s the future, he’s going to be a big player for us etc etc when it goes wrong and expect everything to just work out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NiallH22"> /u/NiallH22 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/weegs3/zak_crawley_when_does_it_become_the_selectors/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/weegs3/zak_crawley_when_does_it_become_the_selectors/">[comments]</a></span>
