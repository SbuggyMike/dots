<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I installed Arch, the tutorial I followed said to install <code>networkmanager</code>, <code>iwd</code>, and <code>dhcpcd</code>.</p> <p>I connected to Wi-Fi with <code>iwctl</code> and <code>dhcpcd</code>, then <code>sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service</code> and <code>sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service</code>.</p> <p>I&#39;ve already looked for solutions, and many say this problem is caused by multiple network managers fighting to connect through a single interface.</p> <p>So I just removed <code>networkmanager</code> and <code>wpa_supplicant</code> so I guess I&#39;m only using <code>iwd</code> and <code>dhcpcd</code> now, but nothing has changed. </p> <p>Is there anything I might still have installed that would be causing this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/loganr914"> /u/loganr914 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6t5e7/wifi_disconnects_and_reconnects_very_often_no/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6t5e7/wifi_disconnects_and_reconnects_very_often_no/">[comments]</a></span>
