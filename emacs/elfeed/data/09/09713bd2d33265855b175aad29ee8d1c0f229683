<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just wanted to give an update on this post from 3 Years ago as I just got this working for myself on Fedora 38. I&#39;d like to add a little extension to it as well so that it is possible to open any newer files within SketchUp Make 2017.</p> <p>Post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drowninginmagots/">u/drowninginmagots</a>:</p> <p>Hello, I just wanted to share how I was able to get free SketchUp to run on Linux Mint. I had an old Windows 7 laptop that I reformatted and downloaded Linux Mint for the OS. When I tried downloading and installing SketchUp Make, It would constantly get stuck in the installation phase (while trying to install Microsoft .NET framework 4.5.2) and would be in a constant loop until I restarted my computer. Learning Blender and FreeCAD was turning out to be a pain, so I worked at figuring out how to get SketchUp to work, even though the general consensus was that it wasn&#39;t possible.</p> <ol> <li>You need to install Wine (free from the Linux software manager)</li> <li>From the cmd line, type &quot;winecfg&quot;, this will take you to the settings for the Wine application. Under the &quot;applications&quot; tab, be sure it is set to Windows 7. In the &quot;libraries&quot; tab, add a new library for &quot;riched20&quot; Apply changes.</li> <li>Download the problem file (Microsoft .NET framework 4.5.2) from Microsoft directly. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642</a> Run this program with Wine to install it.</li> <li>Download SketchUp Make 2017 for Windows and use Wine to install it <a href="https://help.sketchup.com/en/downloading-older-versions">https://help.sketchup.com/en/downloading-older-versions</a></li> <li>After the install, the program should run. I was constantly getting an error pop up that said the SketchUp webhelper was not working. It was more annoying than anything. You can find folder that SketchUp was installed to, and delete the 3 web helper programs. I found them just by doing a search for &quot;web helper&quot; in the search box. This will stop the errors from popping up.</li> </ol> <p>I hope this helps someone!</p> <p>Now to be able to import any files into SketchUp Make 2017 you want that were created with a newer version of SketchUp:</p> <ol> <li>Open Q4Wine (GUI for Wine)</li> <li>Use WinExplorer to locate Plugin Dictionary: (C:/Users/User/AppData/Roaming/SketchUP/Sketchup2017/SketchUp/Plugins)</li> <li>Download this Extension: <a href="https://extensions.sketchup.com/extension/39811dd4-8f44-4aed-bd20-c83f196c55b1/eneroth-open-newer-version">https://extensions.sketchup.com/extension/39811dd4-8f44-4aed-bd20-c83f196c55b1/eneroth-open-newer-version</a></li> <li>Unzip and copy into Plugin Dictionary. Make sure that you have the file ene_open_newer_version.rb right within the Plugins folder and a separate folder with the rest of the extension.</li> <li>Launch SketchUp and you should see under File a tab now that says &quot;Open newer version&quot;.</li> </ol> <p>Extension Manager and Extension Warehouse are not working or are no longer supported, for me doing it this way was the only way.</p> <p>0 comments</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mosilein"> /u/mosilein </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/130qikj/installing_sketchup_make_2017_on_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/130qikj/installing_sketchup_make_2017_on_linux/">[comments]</a></span>
