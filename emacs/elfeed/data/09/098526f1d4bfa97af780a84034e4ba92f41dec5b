Let's get rid of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/02/health/abortion-myths-mental-health-wellness/index.html">right-wing myth</a> that abortions lead to
psychological problems.  They don't.

On the other hand, having a baby does sometimes cause them.  (And
non-mental medical problems, too.)  Being compelled to have a baby you
can't afford to take care of is even worse.
