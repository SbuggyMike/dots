<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I have been working on improving in chess. I&#39;m 14 and have played chess for many years but only recently started playing competitively starting this January. I have found a chess club near me that seems very large (many members and USCF events, NMs, FMs, IMs). I feel a bit intimidated to join but want to improve my skills. I&#39;m pretty bad and am only 1300 on chess.com.</p> <p>Should I join? I&#39;m worried I will just get crushed by everyone.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Excellent_Being3985"> /u/Excellent_Being3985 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1393kue/should_i_join_a_chess_club/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1393kue/should_i_join_a_chess_club/">[comments]</a></span>
