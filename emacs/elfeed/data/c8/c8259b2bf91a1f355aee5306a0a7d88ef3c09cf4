<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>Sometimes when I shutdown emacs and fire it up again I get some errors like this and my perspectives ares gone:</p> <p>Error: Can not autoresume perspectives -- (error Buffer is not associated with any file xxxxxxx )</p> <p>As the error says, the problem is that for some pre-existing buffer in the saved perspective there is not anymore a file to the buffer to load from.</p> <p>This seems like it should have a simple fix, IF THE FILE IS GONE, KILL THE BUFFER! But I did not find how to configure persp-mode to behave like that. Does any one knows how to do it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gutofarias"> /u/gutofarias </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w1z352/perspmode_error_can_not_autoresume_perspectives/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w1z352/perspmode_error_can_not_autoresume_perspectives/">[comments]</a></span>
