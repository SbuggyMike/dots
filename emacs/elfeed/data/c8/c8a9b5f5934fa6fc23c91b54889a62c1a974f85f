Everyone: call on Google to stop collecting
<a href="https://act.weareultraviolet.org/sign/Google_Search_Abortions/">search and location data for abortion seekers</a>.

There is a proxy called LibreX which accesses Google search for you,
but you can connect to it via Tor and not run the JS code it sends.
