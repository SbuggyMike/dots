<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m 1600 and was hoping for any strategies for pawn moves in the endgame when it comes to symmetrical structure and pawn advancement. For example, let’s say king-side me and my opponent haven’t moved any pawns. What is the strategy for advancing pawns? Is there any rule of thumb or deductive concept I should know about? It seems like I always randomly just push a pawn two squares in this situation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DetachedOptimist"> /u/DetachedOptimist </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/131hzab/in_the_endgame_what_do_i_do_with_symmetrical/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/131hzab/in_the_endgame_what_do_i_do_with_symmetrical/">[comments]</a></span>
