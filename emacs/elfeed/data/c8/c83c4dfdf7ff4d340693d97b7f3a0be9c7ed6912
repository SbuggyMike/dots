Most US schools <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/student-monitoring-software-privacy-in-schools/">monitor everything students say and do on their
school-supplied laptop</a>s, and students are in a substantial danger of
being charged or harassed as a result.
<p>
If this massive surveillance continues, parts of the US may jail
students for seeking abortion resources (or birth control, or whatever
the Christian Taliban may prohibit) using those school-supplied
facilities.

A school-supplied laptop that allows connection to anything but the
school's own servers is bait &mdash; tempting students to browse the web
under direct monitoring by the school and the local thug department.
Paradoxical as it may seem, perhaps schools should be legally required
to limit these computers strictly to class assignments, so students won't
make the mistake of using them for their other activities.
