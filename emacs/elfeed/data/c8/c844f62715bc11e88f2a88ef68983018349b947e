<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A while ago I noticed that Spotify released support for playing local files in FLAC format, however AUR Spotify doesn&#39;t seem to recognize files in FLAC format after correctly setting up the file location for my music, only files in mp3 format seem to show up.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I came across <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Linux/Local-Files-doesn-t-work/td-p/4793394">this</a> community forum suggesting that the package ffmpeg-compat-57 was required, I tried installing it both along and as a replacing of ffmpeg4.4, neither resulted in Spotify showing FLAC files. (Although both packages seem to work for playing local files in mp3 format on Spotify)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I wondered if the AUR version didn&#39;t have this feature yet, or perhaps I&#39;m missing something. It crossed my mind that playing local FLAC files could be a premium only feature, but everything I&#39;ve read seems to suggest it is not. Any help is kindly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sad-Mixture-1953"> /u/Sad-Mixture-1953 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wiek80/flac_support_for_aur_spotify/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wiek80/flac_support_for_aur_spotify/">[comments]</a></span>
