<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Stolen shamelessly from <a href="/r/tennis">r/tennis</a>.</p> <p>I don&#39;t want to hear any good reasons - nothing about their stats playing ability, controversies, or their perceived flaws (sporting or moral or otherwise). Just really dumb, superficial, unimportant or flat-out bizarre reasons that you can&#39;t stand a player.</p> <p>For example, I dislike Dawid Malan purely because he looks exactly like this guy I only ever met once at a university party who broke my TV.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ViolatingBadgers"> /u/ViolatingBadgers </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w8vsiw/what_is_the_dumbest_reason_for_why_you_dislike_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w8vsiw/what_is_the_dumbest_reason_for_why_you_dislike_a/">[comments]</a></span>
