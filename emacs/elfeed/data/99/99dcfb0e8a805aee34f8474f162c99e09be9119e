<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First attempt at installing Arch, having some problems. Tried to solve it on my own with googling and wiki reading but I&#39;m kind of at a loss and hoping this sub might be able to help me.</p> <p>Pls forgive me for not providing full output in some places but I did my best to document what I did &amp; and include relevant info.</p> <p>PC is a Dell Optiplex 380. Just fyi.</p> <p>So the wiki pretty much said ethernet should work &#39;out of the box&#39; so to speak. To verify it was working I input ping 8.8.8.8</p> <p>Output: &#39;Network Unreachable.&#39;</p> <p>This is where I realized I had a problem lol. Some post on Arch forums said said it could be a problem with low power mode in BIOS so I turned that off but still got &#39;Network Unreachable&#39;.</p> <p>Another post said it could be a DHCP problem buuut after I tried this next command I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. But I could always be wrong of course.</p> <p>Input: &#39;ip link&#39;</p> <p>Output: 1: lo:&lt;loopback,up,lower,up&gt; ............etc(bunch of numbers and stuff)</p> <p>After some google searching and wiki reading I learned that the lo loopback thing is supposed to be there, but ip link should also return a second output showing my NIC, etc. So I start looking into why it wouldn&#39;t be detecting my NIC.</p> <p>Input: lspci -v</p> <p>This gives me a lot of output but as far as I know the relevant information there is just the kernel module for my NIC which I find and note. &#39;tg3&#39;</p> <p>Input: dmsg | grep tg3</p> <p>Output:</p> <p>[ 7.565849] tg3 0000:02:00.0: No PHY Devices. [ 7.565974] tg3 0000:02:00.0: Problem fetching invariants of chip, aborting</p> <p>Put this error message into google and find some old conversation from 2012 on some .edu website and the person said that loading the kernel module manually with modprobe worked for them?</p> <p>Input: modprobe tg3</p> <p>I got no output for that command. Tried to ping 8.8.8.8 again. Output was still &#39;Network Unreachable&#39;</p> <p>This is kind of where I ran out of ideas. I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know.</p> <p>I still have Linux Mint on this machine &amp; when I load into Mint I have no problems reaching the internet. So I think this may be a problem with Arch, not my router or any dhcp settings.</p> <p>I also tried a usb wifi adapter out of desperation lol but that didn&#39;t work either. </p> <p>This isn&#39;t my daily driver, I&#39;m using Linux Mint on a different machine as my daily driver but didn&#39;t feel like Mint was pushing me to learn &amp; wanted to challenge myself by setting up arch &amp; using it as my fuck around and find out station.</p> <p>I&#39;m still new to Linux so any help or pointing in the right direction regarding this problem is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>If I didn&#39;t provide enough information about something pls just let me know &amp; I&#39;ll boot the pc up and re-enter the commands &amp; give exact outputs</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/phobos_0"> /u/phobos_0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w06xhg/ethernet_issue_during_install/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w06xhg/ethernet_issue_during_install/">[comments]</a></span>
