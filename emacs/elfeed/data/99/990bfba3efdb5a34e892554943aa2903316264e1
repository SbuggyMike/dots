<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve recently started learning Fantasia in D minor for piano, and I&#39;ve fell in love with Mozart ever since. I feel like I never appreciated Mozart enough, and i always had this ignorant belief that people like Mozart just to appease other classical listeners, especially on this sub. I love some sad pieces by Mozart such as Sonata no. 8. But I&#39;d love to hear some more sad pieces by Mozart (except Lacrimosa)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bruhboiman"> /u/bruhboiman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/we5eml/give_me_some_sad_mozart_pieces_sorry_if_a_bit/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/we5eml/give_me_some_sad_mozart_pieces_sorry_if_a_bit/">[comments]</a></span>
