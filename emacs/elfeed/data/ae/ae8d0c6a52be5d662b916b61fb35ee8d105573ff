<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Guys, I want to study linux and build a professional career. Linux is main OS from few months and I am really enjoying it. I am currently working in a networking but L1 and L2 stuff only. Do I need to do some certifications, if yes. Can you please suggest some? There isn&#39;t much studying stuff regarding linux. Can you please guide me, some links or websites or certificates if necessary.</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rocksingh2013"> /u/rocksingh2013 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13hn3f4/linux_studying/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13hn3f4/linux_studying/">[comments]</a></span>
