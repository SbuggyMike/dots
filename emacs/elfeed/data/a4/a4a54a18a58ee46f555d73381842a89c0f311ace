US citizens: phone your senators and urge them to vote to allow the
Equal Rights Amendment to take effect.  The Equal Rights Amendment says,

<blockquote>
     Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged
     by the United States or by any state on account of sex.
</blockquote>
