<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I switched from Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to Arch Linux yesterday and everything works fine for me, but I got a problem with my desktop. There is nothing on desktop except wallpaper and when I right click to desktop it only shows settings and change wallpapers, nothing more. How can I solve this issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/henryxavery"> /u/henryxavery </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7lgyp/gnome_desktop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7lgyp/gnome_desktop/">[comments]</a></span>
