<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I just woke up to <a href="https://youtu.be/UAG5Q8Hovkw">this</a> awesome video by Gary Explains about Linus using an ARM based machine to release the latest version of the kernel. Before watching the video I thought he might be using something like a Pinebook but it turn out he’s running Asahi on an Apple Silicon Mac. I fact checked and found <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wgrz5BBk=rCz7W28Fj_o02s0Xi0OEQ3H1uQgOdFvHgx0w@mail.gmail.com/T/#u">this</a> note by the man himself. </p> <p>I researched a bit and found out he has used macbooks for kernel development before, so it’s not nothing new, but it’s still interesting for me to see him making this move, specially knowing that Asahi is not fully ready yet (I think). Anyways, what are your thoughts on this? Personally I would love to run Linux on an Apple Silicon Mac, it’s hardware it’s just unbelievably good for my liking.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/regexPattern"> /u/regexPattern </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wdgqsf/torvalds_using_asahi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wdgqsf/torvalds_using_asahi/">[comments]</a></span>
