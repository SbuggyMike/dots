<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, often when writing anything music helps tremendously in figuring out what mood I&#39;m going for and I&#39;ve had this idea for one specific scene in the entire project that is classical instead of electronic (synthesizers basically). I&#39;m hoping this contrast will help the dramatic tonal shift and I&#39;m wondering what piece that should be.</p> <p>If anyone has an idea for a piece like that it would be greatly appreciated. I understand I&#39;m being vague and not specifying its usage which would narrow it down but I&#39;m doing that on purpose. I hope this way I can get a decent pool that could influence the way the writing goes. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SirRavenBat"> /u/SirRavenBat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wcuw7n/piece_that_would_work_in_a_cyberpunk_film/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wcuw7n/piece_that_would_work_in_a_cyberpunk_film/">[comments]</a></span>
