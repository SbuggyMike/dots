<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I did a clean install of archlinux using archinstall, opting for the awesome desktop environment on my Thinkpad x230</p> <p>If I plug or unplug my laptop when it&#39;s on, it would shut down right away.</p> <p>This doesn&#39;t happen when I installed the gnome environment using archinstall.</p> <p>Could any of you help me with this. What would be the cause and how should I check the cause of the problem?</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ShouriX"> /u/ShouriX </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3jli3/laptop_promptly_powered_off_when_plugging_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3jli3/laptop_promptly_powered_off_when_plugging_and/">[comments]</a></span>
