Full credit to the team. We didn&#39;t expect the heatwave in England but it felt a bit like home. It was really hot but luckily enough there were no casualties on the field... [What about Phehlukwayo?] He underestimated the size of me! [Batting?] Quinny and Janneman set the platform and Rassie played a special innings. Partnerships were the key. [Spinners in the chase?] We know Markram is a handy allrounder. His bowling is underrated. [Nortje?] He knows his role and stuck to his disciplines.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Rassie van der Dussen</strong> is Player of the Match. &quot;Pretty hot day. We&#39;re used to the heat but it was quite dry which made it difficult. Good toss to win, their fielders struggled in the heat. [Focus on running rather than boundaries?] We came into this tour knowing we&#39;d have to play smart cricket. It&#39;s a massive outfield. The gameplan was to hit the gaps hard. We didn&#39;t hit one six but overall it was a pretty good batting display. All the guys that came in showed good intent, Janneman up front and then Aiden. We&#39;re pretty happy with that batting performance. [Put down a marker?] Definitely. We&#39;ve had 10 good days of preparation and knew it was going to be a tough tour. We&#39;ll enjoy tonight.&quot;</p> <p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=poochi&amp;subject=Bot%20Feedback"><sup>Send feedback</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_schedule"><sup>Schedule</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_help"><sup>Stat Help</sup></a></p> <p><sup>Please don&#39;t post illegal streaming links in match threads</sup></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CricketMatchBot"> /u/CricketMatchBot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w3229q/post_match_thread_south_africa_vs_england/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w3229q/post_match_thread_south_africa_vs_england/">[comments]</a></span>
