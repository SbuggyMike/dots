<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just updated my system after a week, took a bit cus it was 2gb, then I rebooted as per usual, and then all of a sudden started experiencing really annoying mouse bugs. Mouse keeps flickering in and out of existence, teleporting everywhere, moving randomly, etc. Is there a fix? Anything helps, thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/the_maggie"> /u/the_maggie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0vi0m/mouse_keeps_flicking_and_teleporting_everywhere/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0vi0m/mouse_keeps_flicking_and_teleporting_everywhere/">[comments]</a></span>
