<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s Sunday again, and whatever your week brought you it&#39;s time to sit back and relax as you use your infinite wisdom to solve all the problems currently facing a cricket team of your choice. </p> <p>Please use this thread to chip in and discuss your weekly suggested team changes, starting XIs, squad picks, or debate those made by others.</p> <p>A few prompts to get the team cap handout energy going:</p> <ul> <li>What changes would you make to a team?</li> <li>Any new players on the fringe that need to come in? Who makes way?</li> <li>What does your side/squad look like for the next upcoming match/series/tournament?</li> <li>Do you make changes based on the conditions/pitches of upcoming matches?</li> <li>How would you balance the side with batsmen/bowlers/all-rounders/keepers? Sloggers or accumulators? Specialists or multiple role fillers?</li> <li>Any all time XIs, combination XIs, or historical team XIs (or changes to historical teams)?</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator"> /u/AutoModerator </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wi4u4y/selector_sunday_thread/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wi4u4y/selector_sunday_thread/">[comments]</a></span>
