  Offering too much to other countries to free US citizens <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/politics/griner-whelan-russia-biden-analysis/index.html">would put
  more US citizens in danger</a>.

  In my view, a patriotic citizen (of any country) does not ask its
  government to procure per release from a foreign prison through
  concessions that could affect the well-being or interests of the
  country.  I am surprised by the expectation that the head of state
  personally involve perself in such negotiations.
