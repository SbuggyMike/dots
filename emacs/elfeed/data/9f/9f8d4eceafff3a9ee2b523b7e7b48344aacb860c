<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello people. I have been using Arch Linux as my main system on my PC for a while now.</p> <p>The thing is that I decided to try other distributions on other partitions of my SSD.</p> <p>Both Tumbleweed and Fedora could be installed without problems, but they did not recognize the Arch partition in Grub.</p> <p>I decided to do a chroot and go back to the Arch Grub, and so I was able to enter my Arch partition, but with a very high boot time.</p> <p>I must have done something wrong when chrooting, because before it was booting very fast, with no problems.</p> <p>Also, as it didn&#39;t recognize my Tumbleweed partition in Grub, I decided to reinstall Tumbleweed, and now my Arch partition appears in Grub. I think I simply chose the wrong /boot partition before.</p> <p>But the thing is that it still takes a long time to boot Arch.</p> <p>After selecting it in Grub, it stays on a black screen with the text on the top left:</p> <pre><code>Starting version 251.3-1-arch </code></pre> <p>And then, after a good wait, it brings up the following lines:</p> <pre><code>[ TIME ] Timed out waiting for device /dev/disk/by-uuid/31fe4ea4-003c-4c31-947c-88874131ccd3. [DEPEND] Dependency failed for /dev/disk/by-uuid/31fe4ea4-003c-4c31-947c-88874131ccd3. [DEPEND] Dependency failed for Swaps.
