<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With your help, I&#39;d like to to understand how exporting completion candidates works with consult and embark.</p> <p>Here&#39;s a use-case that comes up a lot in my flow as a programmer: find &amp; replace text matches.</p> <p>You might say <code>projectile-replace</code> works great but it prompts for every replace and is super annoying, especially on very large code-bases.</p> <p>So how to do it with consult and embark?</p> <p>I think I have come close with the following flow:</p> <p>- <code>M-x consult-git-grep</code></p> <p>- <code>#match-this-text</code></p> <p>Now, if I <code>M-x embark-collect</code>, I end up with an embark buffer. If, on the other hand, I <code>M-x embark-export</code>, I end up with a grep buffer. </p> <p>Which of the two buffers do I need (why?), and how do I go about replacing the text I&#39;m after?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/biolatitude"> /u/biolatitude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w19lby/understanding_exporting_of_completion_candidates/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w19lby/understanding_exporting_of_completion_candidates/">[comments]</a></span>
