<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyeone.</p> <p>I am fairly new to Arch (and Linux in general). I installed arch using the btrfs . Everything worked great. I was using it for some time too. At some point I installed timeshift and made a btrfs backup. It seemed to work (showed up in the list of snapshots). I pressed recover (cause what is the point of having a recovery system, if I do not know that I can use it). It made a second recovery point (Before restoring).<br/> I rebooted.<br/> I says &quot;You are in emergency mode. After logging in, type &quot;journalctl -xb&quot; to view system logs, &quot;systemctl reboot&quot; to reboot, &quot;systemctl default&quot; or &quot;exit&quot; to dfefault mode.&quot;</p> <p>When I try default more, it goes back to here. When I try to use timeshift --restore and select the initial (or any) snapshot, I get the following output</p> <p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/W9hldk2.jpg"><strong>https://i.imgur.com/W9hldk2.jpg</strong></a><br/> (sorry, could not embed it. It says &quot;Found stale mount for device /dev/nvme0n1p2 at path /run/timeshfit/837/backup. \n Unmounted successfully. \n E: Failed to remove directory. \n Ret=256&quot;.</p> <p>Would really appreciate some help.</p> <p>Cheers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AccessIllustrious948"> /u/AccessIllustrious948 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0lu68/help_timeshift_with_btrfs_can_not_boot_emergency/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0lu68/help_timeshift_with_btrfs_can_not_boot_emergency/">[comments]</a></span>
