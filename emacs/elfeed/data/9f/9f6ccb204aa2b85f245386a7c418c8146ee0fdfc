<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everybody! I’m looking for intermediate sight reading exercises for piano. More specifically, I’m looking for more chordal exercises (single note and intervalic exercises would also be fine but not exactly what I’m looking for). </p> <p>I guess I’m looking for something akin to the 100 Progressive Studies by Czerny? Not totally sure but open to any suggestions you have! </p> <p>Thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/trishfishmarshall"> /u/trishfishmarshall </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13jjccz/looking_for_sight_reading_recommendations_piano/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13jjccz/looking_for_sight_reading_recommendations_piano/">[comments]</a></span>
