 
<p>
  A politician who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/04/boris-johnson-pm-damage-go-disaster-meltdown">openly defies norms of honesty and gets away with that
  permanently erodes those norms</a>.
  Especially when he gets away with it
  because his party chooses to sacrifice the norms to keep him in office.
  His eventual defeat does not restore the lost practices of honesty, nor
  the lost trust that depended on those practices.
<p>
  This, for example, the persistent and unlimited falsification of the wrecker
  taught most Republicans to support lies when they lead to victory.
