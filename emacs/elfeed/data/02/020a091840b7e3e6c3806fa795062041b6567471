<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m running Arch with KDE and I am forced to use wifi at my place.</p> <p>Today, while I was using my PC, out of nowhere I got disconnected of my access point and it wouldn&#39;t connect back, meanwhile the wifi would work fine in my Android phone. I tried making a hotspot with my phone my it would also not connect.</p> <p>Checking dmesg I could see it would randomly authenticate and assosciate but eventually I would get a: wlan0: deauthenticating from MAC_ADDRESS by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)</p> <p>After doing some research I found this could be a NetworkManager wpa_supplicant concurrency problem, so I tried doing: sudo systemctl disable --now wpa_supplicant</p> <p>And turns out after doing this it could actually connect to my wifi (not to my phone hotspot tho). But I quickly realized it was so slow to the point it was unusable, when on my phone it&#39;s working just fine.</p> <p>Checking dmesg again the only odd thing I could see if plenty of audit messages for NetworkManager</p> <p>I don&#39;t think this is a firmware issue because it literally went from working fine to not working without me doing any upgrades it touching configuration. I tried restoring a ystem Timeshift snapshot but it also did not help. Does anybody have an idea of where I should look into next?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kylwaR"> /u/kylwaR </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8sw6w/wifi_issues/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8sw6w/wifi_issues/">[comments]</a></span>
