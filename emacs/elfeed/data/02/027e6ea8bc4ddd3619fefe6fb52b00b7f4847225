<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I like the idea of only horizontally scrolling the current line, ie. <code>(setq auto-hscroll-mode &#39;current-line)</code>, but it has a few quirks.</p> <p>First, if you scroll to the end of a long line, and then move to the next line, it will horizontally scroll that line, even if it easily fits on the screen. This pushes most of the short line off the left edge of the screen.</p> <p>Second, It would be nice for point to stay as far right as possible (at the left edge of the right margin) when horizontally scrolling. This would make it so point would stay a few columns from the right edge the entire time the line is horizontally scrolled. So even when moving point left, the line under point would horizontally scroll to the right until the line is no longer horizontally scrolling, then point would actually start moving toward the left edge of the screen.</p> <p>Does anyone know of such a thing? or can anyone help point me in the right direction to create a minor mode that would do this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pa2ees"> /u/pa2ees </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wgef0b/looking_for_better_alternative_to_autohscrollmode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wgef0b/looking_for_better_alternative_to_autohscrollmode/">[comments]</a></span>
