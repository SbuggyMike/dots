<p>I and several associates want to improve some Google Fonts fonts. But our PRs are being ignored, for months or even years in some cases. What should we do?  Isn't the developer of an accepted Google Fonts font required to pay attention to PRs improving and/or fixing bugs in their fonts? Any recommendations?</p>
