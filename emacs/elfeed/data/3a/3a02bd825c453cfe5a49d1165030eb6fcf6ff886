<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use TRAMP a lot to access remote Linux machines (from a local macOS machine), usually without any problems. I try to do the same to access remote macOS machines, but I have never managed to get it to work.</p> <p>From within Emacs using vterm I can ssh into remote macOS machines just fine. But if I try to connect to the same machine using TRAMP to open the remote user&#39;s home directory in Dired it always fails. Or, more correct, it takes ages to complete, never actually connecting.</p> <p>This is true for all remote macOS machines I have tried to connect to using TRAMP. None of them uses any fancy oh-my-zsh, the prompts are standard macOS zsh prompts.</p> <p>Is there anything specific with remote macOS that messes up TRAMP?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mickesp"> /u/mickesp </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/131kyys/unable_to_use_tramp_with_remote_macos_machines/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/131kyys/unable_to_use_tramp_with_remote_macos_machines/">[comments]</a></span>
