<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently went to a Chess Tournament and I lost the majority of my matches. I am Rated 447 and I will probably drop in rating, I always stress about people being a higher rating and I can&#39;t get that thought out of my head. I want to make the top team in my club and achieve a rating of 500, but I can&#39;t do that without improving. I am 1100 on chess.com, so why can&#39;t I play good when I&#39;m in a tournament?</p> <p>Chess.com account <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/pogminty">https://www.chess.com/member/pogminty</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PogMinty"> /u/PogMinty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wi4p59/ive_been_losing_a_lot_how_can_i_stop_losing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wi4p59/ive_been_losing_a_lot_how_can_i_stop_losing/">[comments]</a></span>
