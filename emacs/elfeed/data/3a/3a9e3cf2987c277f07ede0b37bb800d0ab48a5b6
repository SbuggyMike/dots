<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to copy an org mode outline to give to someone who doesn&#39;t have emacs. According to this: <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Hard-indentation.html">https://orgmode.org/manual/Hard-indentation.html</a> , I should be able to hard indent with spaces by setting those three variables. But the ascii document is still indented with asterisks. I also tried turning off <code>org-indent-mode</code>, still has leading asterisks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Possession3746"> /u/No-Possession3746 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w4lrkw/how_to_hard_indent_with_spaces_in_orgmode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w4lrkw/how_to_hard_indent_with_spaces_in_orgmode/">[comments]</a></span>
