<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that Ubuntu 23.04 and Fedora 38, which are both stable-release distros, have already updated to Gnome 44. However, Arch Linux, being a rolling release, still seems to be on Gnome 43. I&#39;m not complaining but genuinely curious to learn more about the process behind this. Can anyone provide some insight into why Arch might not have Gnome 44 yet, despite its rolling-release nature?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lizard_king_421"> /u/lizard_king_421 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/133h0i1/understanding_the_process_behind_gnome_44s/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/133h0i1/understanding_the_process_behind_gnome_44s/">[comments]</a></span>
