<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been using EAF&#39;s browser and it works decently well for a lot of things, but reading things like pdfs or selecting text is uncomfortable at best. Besides, installing EAF feels like exiting emacs entirely. I have seen some things done with xwidget-webkit that seem cool, and this is already integrated into emacs (although I would have to compile it myself). I am wondering what is the bleeding-edge browser experience available in emacs right now (that one could install from one of the repos like MELPA or by compiling emacs with certain options). Alternatively, I have also heard of Nyxt. Could Nyxt be used instead of emacs?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cuntymccuntlicker"> /u/cuntymccuntlicker </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wdwmch/what_is_the_current_state_of_the_art_for_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wdwmch/what_is_the_current_state_of_the_art_for_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
