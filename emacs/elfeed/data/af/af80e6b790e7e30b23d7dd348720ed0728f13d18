<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a way to run a GUI app remotely, similar to ssh -X. All I&#39;ve found is a package called waypipe, but there is very little information about how to use it, and I&#39;m not sure if it even works.</p> <p>Does anyone know if there is a plan to add Wayland forwarding to SSH, or some way to forward Wayland apps?</p> <p>EDIT: After some advice from <a href="/u/throwaway6560192">u/throwaway6560192</a>, I figured it out:</p> <p>On my setup, QT apps will only run over waypipe after setting QT_QPA_PLATFORM=kde. Additionally, some graphical glitches were being caused by not loading the theme correctly, which can be fixed by setting XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=kde (on both waypipe and ssh -X).</p> <p>~~~ $ waypipe ssh user@server user@server&#39;s password: $ QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=kde dolphin ~~~</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/den_the_terran"> /u/den_the_terran </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wawv7c/is_there_an_equivalent_to_ssh_x_for_wayland/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wawv7c/is_there_an_equivalent_to_ssh_x_for_wayland/">[comments]</a></span>
