Already some places on Earth occasionally experience fatal weather,
for short periods.  But we <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/31/why-you-need-to-worry-about-the-wet-bulb-temperature">know only theoretically</a> at which point the
combined heat and humidity (measured as the "wet bulb temperature")
will kill a large fraction of humans.

I fear we will get clear empirical evidence about this question in the
next 20 years.
