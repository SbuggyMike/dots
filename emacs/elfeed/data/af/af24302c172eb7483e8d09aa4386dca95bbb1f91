<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I am using a TP-Link bluetooth USB dongle to connect with my headphones, and the sounds sometimes skips horribly. The problem seems to be <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth#Audio_devices_start_to_skip_at_short_distance_from_dongle">this one</a> and indeed when I run <code>lsusb</code> I see my dongle on the same bus as the other peripherals (keyboard, mouse and a wifi dongle). However all the USB ports available on my PC seem to belong to the same bus (except one USB 2 port which yields even worse sound), so the proposed solution on the wiki doesn&#39;t work for me. Is there another way to fix this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/appendThyme"> /u/appendThyme </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8g1k8/bluetooth_headphones_skipping_i_cant_use_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8g1k8/bluetooth_headphones_skipping_i_cant_use_a/">[comments]</a></span>
