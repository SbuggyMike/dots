<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I heard a short expert of Gould playing the c minor sinfonia and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0pfoDy04GKqJgSODB1VxYN?si=8dHaFFN5TZCqr6c82Ux9hQ">gigue from English 2 in a minor</a>, and I fell in love with them so I would like to discover more of Bachâ€™s masterpieces. And if you have the time also please drop a few of your favorite orchestral/choral works from Bach. Thank you all. Edit: I like polyphony so yea</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pot4toM4n07"> /u/Pot4toM4n07 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wd5kf6/can_you_guys_give_me_your_top_5_keyboard/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wd5kf6/can_you_guys_give_me_your_top_5_keyboard/">[comments]</a></span>
