*You have to wonder: if [the corrupter] did shoot someone on Fifth
Avenue, would all those prosecutors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/13/criminal-investigation-donald-trump">still be struggling</a> with the
question of whether they could or should indict him?*
<p>
I see the sense in thinking five times before turning a question of
politics into a matter of criminal justice.  That can undermine the
political system.  Sad to say the Republicans have already gone much
farther than this, and the line these prosecutors are trying to hold
has already fallen.  Now the question is whether to fight back or let
them win.
