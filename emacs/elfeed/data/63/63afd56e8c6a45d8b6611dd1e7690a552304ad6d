<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want something between <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> &amp; <code>&lt;/kbd&gt;</code> to be font-locked w/ the keyboard face and then exported to latex using the menu-keys package. Has anyone done something similar. I saw something in the past about doing something similar with quotation marks, but I couldn&#39;t find that anymore.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Far-Anywhere2876"> /u/Far-Anywhere2876 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jnsd8/how_to_create_custom_font_lock_and_export_filters/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jnsd8/how_to_create_custom_font_lock_and_export_filters/">[comments]</a></span>
