<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL;DR - I made a load of opening/endgame studies on Lichess that some of you might find useful, link below:</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://lichess.org/study/by/BenedictChessman">https://lichess.org/study/by/BenedictChessman</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>For those who are interested, I became absolutely obsessed with chess about two and a half years ago during the first lockdown (I was on furlough then later made redundant with six months garden leave pay so had a lot of free time to get stuck into the game). I learned the rules as a child but never studied openings or tactics etc. As an adult beginner, I made the common mistake of putting way too much emphasis on openings and until relatively recently was relying on opening traps and getting an advantage early. The middlegame is still therefore the weakest aspect of my game, and the openings studies are quite often focussed on opening traps which can be generally be identified where moves are given a &#39;mistake&#39; or &#39;blunder&#39; annotation. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Some of the studies are more thorough than others, I play e5 as black against e4 so any 1.e4 e5 openings are covered fairly comprehensively (although even for those I&#39;m sure there will be some lines I&#39;ve missed). The lines I play (and therefore the studies with the greatest level of detail) are generally sound although I&#39;m happy going into decent but suboptimal lines if there are lots of potential ways for the opponent to go wrong (e.g. Fritz variation of the Two Knights Defence, Ponziani Opening, Budapest Gambit etc.) The only really dubious opening I&#39;ve gone into lots of detail for is the Stafford because I love it, but most of the studies also include main theoretical lines in there to learn in case opponents defend properly. The endgame studies are all fairly basic but I would say they are useful for anyone below 2000 who hasn&#39;t properly looked into them before.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Over the last 6 months or so I&#39;ve started to realise that to continue improving I will need to focus more on middlegame tactics and strategy, however I still find studying openings absolutely fascinating - whether I play them or not - so will sporadically continue to add to the collection (there are plenty of offbeat/dubious openings I haven&#39;t made studies for yet - Owen&#39;s Defence, Nimzowich Defence, Grob, Colle, Torre, Englund Gambit, Busch-Gass Gambit, Elephant Gambit, Latvian Gambit, Nimzo-Larsen Attack, Hippo, Walrus, Crab, Hedgehog etc. etc.). Anyway I figured it was worth sharing them in case anyone else got some value from them, please let me know if you spot any mistakes or have any general comments I could incorporate.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/itsnotacompetition"> /u/itsnotacompetition </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w8lmvp/my_lichess_studies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w8lmvp/my_lichess_studies/">[comments]</a></span>
