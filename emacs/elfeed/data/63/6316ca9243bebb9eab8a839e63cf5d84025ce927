  The new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/12/portuguese-parliament-legalises-euthanasia-after-long-battle">Portuguese euthanasia law</a> seems to have the same flaw as most
such laws.
  It is limited to people whose illness is terminal, which means their
suffering is sure to end in a matter of months anyway.  If your
suffering could continue for years, this law refuses to help you.
What perversity!

It also excludes foreigners.
