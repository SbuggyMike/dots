<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In 1984 I turned 10 years old and my dad&#39;s first wife&#39;s husband, Bob got me the soundtrack for the movie Amadeus that had just come out. Yes my family spent every Christmas with my dad&#39;s ex&#39;s family. It was always a great time. Anyways I listened to the tape on the way home in my Walkman that night as my dad drove the 3 hours. The last half of side two was so emotionally touching I never stopped listening since. </p> <p>In the early 1990s Best Buy came out and it was known for having large Classical music sections of classical CDs at ridiculous prices. $0.99 and such. My collection grew immensely from that point to today. Mostly vinyl now. All thanks to Bob.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PianoMike74"> /u/PianoMike74 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/132fk68/what_album_or_event_brought_you_to_classical_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/132fk68/what_album_or_event_brought_you_to_classical_music/">[comments]</a></span>
