Bernie Sanders: *Let's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/14/us-microchip-industry-bernie-sanders">rebuild the US microchip industry &mdash; not give it
a $50bn-plus check</a>.*
<p>
*&hellip; in order to make more profits, these companies took
government money and used it to ship good-paying jobs abroad. Now, as a
reward for that bad behavior, these same companies are in line to
receive a giant taxpayer handout to undo the damage that they did.*
<p>
If the US government does give these companies a subsidy, it should attach
conditions &mdash; let us turn off the DRM, the management engine, and so on.
