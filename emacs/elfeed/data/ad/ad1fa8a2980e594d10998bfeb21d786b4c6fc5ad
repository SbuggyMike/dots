<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So the other day i played some pieces for my family on my ocarina and even though there were just some people of my family (9 persons) i was extremely nervous and my hands were shaking so much i couldnt hold my instrument and i had to pause. After some time i tried again, my hands were still shaking but i was able to play a little bit but i made some minor mistakes which still bother me... Before that i only played for my mother where my hands didnt shake...</p> <p>Also i want to add that i think i play my instrument pretty decent. When i play for myself or my mother i barely make any mistakes</p> <p>anyway i would appreciate some tips for not being stressed out so much :) also if this is not the correct sub please let me know which would fit better for my question, thank you :D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AnyAd4882"> /u/AnyAd4882 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/130at4l/tips_for_not_being_stressed_outnervous_while/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/130at4l/tips_for_not_being_stressed_outnervous_while/">[comments]</a></span>
