<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>so basically I made a dumb mistake while partitioning and gave only 6.8 gb to dev/sda1 (as or rn 93% usage) and have 220gb on /dev/sda2 (3% usage) and I&#39;ve made a lot of changes so I kinda don&#39;t want to do everything again. Question is, can I move space from sda2 to sda1 without losing any data and having to do everything from the start? feel free to roast me in the comments</p> <p>edit1: Idk if this is of any use but it&#39;s BIOS MBR</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Outzide_"> /u/Outzide_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wjr016/increase_size_of_devsda1/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wjr016/increase_size_of_devsda1/">[comments]</a></span>
