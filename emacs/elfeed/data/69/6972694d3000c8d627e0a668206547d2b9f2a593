Indiana's attorney general is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/us/caitlin-bernard-indiana-ag-investigation-consumer-complaints/index.html">a religious fanatic</a>.  He is looking for
any possible excuse to harass Dr Caitlin Bernard, including "complaints"
about her from people who never met her or had anything to do with her.
