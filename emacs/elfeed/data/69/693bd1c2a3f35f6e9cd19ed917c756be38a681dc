<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>Is it possible to have a web-based interactive overlay inside a text buffer in Emacs? </p> <p>Something similar in UX to how images or org-transclusion overlays are displayed inside org-mode buffers. I am looking specifically for in-place rendering, not in a separate buffer. My use case is rendering html export blocks inside an org file to have an interactive notebook like experience, without exporting the whole document to html and viewing it in a browser. </p> <p>This would allow one to use Emacs as a self-sufficient interactive environment, bringing interactive plots, boards, diagrams, graphs, tables etc. directly into already powerful text editing environment. This functionality exists <em>a priori</em> in web-based applications like Obsidian, VS Code (even with inline web-views), but those either become slower with each notebook cell, have json as a file format, or do not have serious text editing capabilities. I realize that such overlays are niceties, and one can always export and view the documents, but I believe that the described approach is alluring to many because it does not force one to split their thinking between creating and viewing.</p> <p>If there is no such package at the moment, I would be willing to implement it myself; however, I want to ask people who looked into Emacs rendering and text overlay capabilities if something of that sort is even possible. Or is it easier to rewrite Emacs GUI with something like Tauri? :)</p> <p>I am also happy to hear about other approaches or views on this problem which worked for you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alexander_demy"> /u/alexander_demy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb3kmq/web_overlays_inside_text_buffers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb3kmq/web_overlays_inside_text_buffers/">[comments]</a></span>
