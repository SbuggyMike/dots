<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty new to classical music, but I&#39;ve been warming up to the genre recently. I wanted to try some string music and I heard that Haydn was a good place to start. On Spotify, &quot;The Haydn Project&quot; is a compilation of Haydn string quartets. The playing is really good and I wanted to recommend it. It&#39;s good for newbies. I don&#39;t know how much an experienced listener would enjoy it--you might find it boring because you already know all the pieces. Anyway, if you&#39;re looking for something classic among the classical, I highly recommend The Haydn Project!</p> <p>BTW sorry if this post isn&#39;t appropriate, I didn&#39;t see any rules prohibiting a post recommending something but if it&#39;s not allowed I apologize</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KingWithAKnife"> /u/KingWithAKnife </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wgy2wx/the_haydn_project_on_spotify_is_really_good/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wgy2wx/the_haydn_project_on_spotify_is_really_good/">[comments]</a></span>
