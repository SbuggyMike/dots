<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard the term &quot;dangerous&quot; applied mostly to Wagner&#39;s Tristan und Isolde, which is noted for its unrelenting emotional intensity combined with a pessimistic Schopenhauerian philosophy. Contemporary psychiatrists said it could induce &quot;hysteria&quot;, and even Wagner himself noted that a convincing performance might drive people insane, so there ought to only be mediocre ones.</p> <p>Anyways, I was in a depressive funk on Tuesday and after failing to &quot;cheer myself up&quot; with lighter music I thought, why not embrace it? I put on Tchaikovsky&#39;s 6th Symphony (Pathetique), which I&#39;m familiar with but has never been my favorite. But playing it in that mood was like hearing it again for the first time. When I got to the 4th movement, I was crying in a state of complete agony, as if it perfectly communicated the struggle and sometimes despair at being human. The intensity was totally overwhelming and I would also call it &quot;dangerous&quot; music.</p> <p>I&#39;m interesting in hearing any other recommendations for &quot;dangerous&quot; music, the type you would only listen to in certain circumstances and with a measure of caution?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CouchieWouchie"> /u/CouchieWouchie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/whb7qn/most_dangerous_classical_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/whb7qn/most_dangerous_classical_music/">[comments]</a></span>
