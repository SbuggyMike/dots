<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys I have been playing for almost 2 years now and right now I find that I have been stuck in 1400 (<a href="https://chess.com">chess.com</a> rapid) for quite some time. I dont make blunders like hang pieces for no reason but from what I have identified in my reviews is that I make a move and slowly give away my advantage. Can you perhaps give me any tips on what to study on that can help me out ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Johnilakos"> /u/Johnilakos </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/139fvlr/stuck_at_1400_elo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/139fvlr/stuck_at_1400_elo/">[comments]</a></span>
