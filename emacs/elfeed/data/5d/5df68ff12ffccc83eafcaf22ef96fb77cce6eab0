Idiotic UK bureaucracy incorrectly denied the citizenship of many UK
citizens who came there long ago as children from colonies in the
Caribbean.  The Tory government was pressured to acknowledge these
wrongs and set up a scheme to right them.  But the Tory inclination
never to give a non-rich citizen a break <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/18/suella-braverman-windrush-scandal-survivors-compensation">eventually won out over
    righting wrongs</a>.

As long as the watchword is, "When in doubt, kick them out," it
won't do the job.
