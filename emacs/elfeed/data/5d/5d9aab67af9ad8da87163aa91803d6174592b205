<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I replaced my dying HDD with an SSD in laptop.It&#39;s a 240GB one(222.6GB usable).Is it possible to create partition of 600mb(Boot),72GB(Root) and use the remaining 150GB to store my music collection and some movies?</p> <p>This is the how I&#39;ve thought of mounting before generating fstab</p> <p>For / partition mount /dev/sda2 /mnt</p> <p>For efi partition mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi</p> <p>Remaining 150GB mkdir -p /mnt/MyFiles mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/MyFiles</p> <p>swapfile Create a swapfile and add it to fstab.</p> <p>I know that SSD should always have 20% of free space.My main question is does trim work on all the partions in the fstab file or do i have to automount it(150GB partition) for fstrim.timer to work.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mysuravnu"> /u/mysuravnu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzhi8v/do_trim_work_on_all_partions_that_are_in_the_fstab/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzhi8v/do_trim_work_on_all_partions_that_are_in_the_fstab/">[comments]</a></span>
