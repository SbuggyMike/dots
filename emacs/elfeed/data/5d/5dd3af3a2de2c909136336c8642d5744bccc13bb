<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In Karabiner I binded my F21 to a different key on my keyboard and it is not registered in Emacs.</p> <p>I see the keycode f21 when I press it in Karabiner EventViewer as you can see here: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ELylaKn.png">https://i.imgur.com/ELylaKn.png</a></p> <p>I have tried f22 as well. Doesn&#39;t work.</p> <p>In Emacs I cannot make it run, e.g. this doesn&#39;t work:</p> <pre><code> (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&lt;f21&gt; t&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (find-file &quot;~/Documents/test.txt&quot;))) </code></pre> <p>But this does work:</p> <pre><code> (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&lt;f15&gt; t&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (find-file &quot;~/Documents/test.txt&quot;))) </code></pre> <p>Also, the f20 triggers C-p or something but that is some Menu key issue with macOS so I will just don&#39;t use that like that.</p> <p>But I would really like to use f21 - f24 or even higher as I am planning to purchasing X-keys programmable keypad and would like to use it with Emacs.</p> <p>Thanks for any advice how to make the function keys about 20 work in Emacs on macOS.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/East_Staff3288"> /u/East_Staff3288 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w49muw/emacs_is_not_registering_function_keys_above_20/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w49muw/emacs_is_not_registering_function_keys_above_20/">[comments]</a></span>
