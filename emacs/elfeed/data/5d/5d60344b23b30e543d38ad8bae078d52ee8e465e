<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! In the movie Amadeus from 1984 Mozart and Salieri have some fun playing on the piano in the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK3OUCw0H8Y">scene</a>.</p> <p>Is there way to get a hold of only the part that Mozart plays? Without his laugh etc. I really, really like the short tune and would like to listen to it without hearing the casual banter and laugh by Mozart.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Starkheiser"> /u/Starkheiser </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/whus7h/amadeus_1984_mozarts_welcome_march/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/whus7h/amadeus_1984_mozarts_welcome_march/">[comments]</a></span>
