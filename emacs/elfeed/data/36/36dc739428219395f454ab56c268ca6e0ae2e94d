<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First I want to state that this is not a Windows bashing post, I&#39;m using Windows, Linux &amp; MacOS on a daily basis and I have my preferences with them all for different tasks, but since I started using Windows again for some .NET stuff a while back, I can&#39;t help but notice how much slower Windows is compared to both MacOS and Linux but especially Linux.</p> <p>On a computer I run both Windows and Linux dual boot, I&#39;ve tested a simple thing such as deleting files. If there are many different files, (like 50-100k) the opperation takes maybe 10x longer on Windows than on Linux. There are many more similar things.</p> <p>Have anyone else noticed the same thing and if it&#39;s universal, why do you think that is the case?</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>EDIT: </p> <p>Thanks for all the detailed answers! This was very educational for me, good points.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cajmorgans"> /u/cajmorgans </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w7no0p/why_are_most_operations_in_windows_much_slower/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w7no0p/why_are_most_operations_in_windows_much_slower/">[comments]</a></span>
