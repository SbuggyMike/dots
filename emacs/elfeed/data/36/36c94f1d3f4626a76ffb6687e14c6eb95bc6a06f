<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My first language is not English and so my keyboard layout is not the US layout. In many international layouts, the right Alt is AltGr and does not work as a Meta key. I like this keyboard layout otherwise.</p> <p>Ideally, I would like to not have to move my hands away from the home row, but having only the left Alt available as Meta and reaching for AltGr (right Alt) from time to time breaks my flow.</p> <p>I tried switching CapsLock with AltGr and this would be the ideal layout. Using xmodmap, I think I was able to do it, but I could not understand what I did satisfactorily even after reading the doc. I don&#39;t like using tools that I cannot understand.</p> <p>Also something does not feel right about having a &quot;non standard&quot; keyboard layout. I don&#39;t want to make my life harder if I use another computer or OS. Do you have an opinion on that?</p> <p>What is your personal setup?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rrdoa"> /u/rrdoa </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w5kbam/emacs_key_bindings_and_keyboard_layout_how_do_you/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w5kbam/emacs_key_bindings_and_keyboard_layout_how_do_you/">[comments]</a></span>
