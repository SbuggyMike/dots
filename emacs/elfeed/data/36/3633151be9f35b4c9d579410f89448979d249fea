<p>&#8216;This decision of Chief Master Shuman concerns the circumstances in which the Court might refuse to bless a decision of pension scheme trustees, with particular reference to the meaning of “necessaries of life”, the conflicted position of member-trustees, and the relevance of disputed matters of fact. It will be important both for those considering the payment of discretionary benefits from pension schemes, including the interrelationship of scheme rules and the authorised payments regime under the Finance Act 2004, as well as more generally in relation to the robust approach the Court should take to beneficiaries seeking to oppose the blessing of trustee decisions.&#8217;</p>
