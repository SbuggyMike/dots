<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! I want to install archlinux without any desktop environment, but I want a tilling window manager (I haven&#39;t decided yet which one to use). I have been using manjaro with kde plasma for around 8 months. I use visual studio code and postman on a regular basis - I need these two everyday.</p> <p>My goal is to reduce mouse usage to bare minimum. I only want to use mouse for browsing websites. I&#39;m planning to use neovim or vim instead of visual studio code (for postman I don&#39;t know anything yet!). I want to train myself to be terminal only, I mean I want to do everything from terminal. So I assume archlinux would be a great choice.</p> <p>Now I&#39;m using zsh, but in archlinux I&#39;m thinking of using &quot;fish&quot;. I heard about alacritty terminal emulator, I want to use that.</p> <p>So far I have used linux mint, ubuntu, debian, manjaro. I didn&#39;t need to configure installation - it was very easy. But yesterday I read installation guide from arch wiki. It&#39;s kind of a lot to take. </p> <p>My laptop has 512 gb ssd and 16 gb ram with an i5 11gen inten processor and integrated irisxe graphics card. It&#39;s a very new machine, bought it around 8 months ago. Currently I&#39;m using btrfs file system for exactly no particular reason, but it&#39;s faster to create a timeshift snapshot. Yeah, I use timeshift often and each time I update system, it creates a new snapshot. So far I haven&#39;t broken my manjaro system yet.</p> <p>Arch wiki installation guide suggests to use ext4. But I don&#39;t know which one to pick ! What is more optimal for archlinux? What do you guys use? </p> <p>I&#39;m also confused about swap partition. I don&#39;t know if I should create one in archlinux! I&#39;m not using any swap partition in manjaro. What do you guys suggest? </p> <p>Any archlinux user here who is using arch as I described above?? Any suggestions / advice??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/royrustdev"> /u/royrustdev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2jygn/install_and_configure_archlinux_without_any/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2jygn/install_and_configure_archlinux_without_any/">[comments]</a></span>
