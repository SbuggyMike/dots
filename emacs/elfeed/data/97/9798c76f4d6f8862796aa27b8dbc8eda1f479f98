<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is just a useful thing I’ve learned from experience. Maybe you already know this or maybe you don’t, so I will say it anyway. </p> <p>Basically, this is about attacking your opponent’s knight with a piece in such a way that the knight cannot attack that piece on the next move. Knowing this is very useful in fast time controls as it avoids unnecessary calculation. For example, if you attack a knight vertically or horizontally with your king, that knight cannot check you on the next move. However, you can run into a check if you attack it diagonally. For rooks, the same applies almost. You can extend this to bishops and queens.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sir_rachh"> /u/sir_rachh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w7ncm8/how_to_attack_a_knight/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w7ncm8/how_to_attack_a_knight/">[comments]</a></span>
