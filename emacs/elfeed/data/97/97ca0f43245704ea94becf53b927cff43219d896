<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all, I was playing with adding holidays to calendar-holidays and I suddenly remembered, a long long time ago, I used to have configured in my emacs on a long-gone system, something where diary entries from the Lord of the Rings timeline would show in calendar/diary. Something like &quot;Fellowship leaves Rivendell&quot; on such-and-such a day. Does this strike a bell with anyone? Is there something out there to add this to my diary?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wombatz"> /u/wombatz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13igcy8/looking_for_lord_of_the_rings_emacs_diary/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13igcy8/looking_for_lord_of_the_rings_emacs_diary/">[comments]</a></span>
