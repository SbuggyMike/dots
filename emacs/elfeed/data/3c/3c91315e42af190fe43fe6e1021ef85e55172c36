<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Until I am able to afford a 1440p monitor, I&#39;m looking to see if it is possible to use my desktop at a higher resolution than my monitor&#39;s native 1080p. It&#39;s not just for luxury sake, I&#39;ll explain my reasonings below.</p> <p>A few things come into play here:</p> <ul> <li>1080p 144hz LG Monitor</li> <li>OBS, which records at 1080p 60fps</li> <li>Youtube. For smaller channels, uploading a 1080p file gives you the AVC codec, which will significantly degrade the video quality no matter how the source file was. <strong>2560x1440 resolution and above triggers the VP9 codec which is multitudes better in quality. This has led to upscaling the 1080p file to 1440p before uploading as being sort of a workaround for bad Youtube AVC encoding.</strong> A chain link fence in the distance uploaded in 1080p for example would usually get reduced to pixels. You can test it yourself by uploading a 1080p file and clicking &quot;Stats for Nerds&quot; on the Youtube video. 1080p gets AVC, 1440p always gets VP9 no matter what.</li> </ul> <p>I do the aforementioned upscale workaround currently. I record at OBS indistinguishable quality (massive file sizes) then upscale using Handbrake. It is the only way I am able to upload to Youtube without the quality becoming unwatchable at parts. But I have been looking for a way to workaround this, to be able to just upload true 1440p to rid myself the 15-20 hour encoding times (and the general guilt of upscaling in the first place). It works every time and the videos look amazing, but I&#39;d rather go legit 1440p.</p> <p>Here are the ideas I have in mind:</p> <ul> <li>Buy a 1440p monitor (work in progress)</li> <li>Custom higher resolution directly from OBS (I have not found a way how, 1080 seems to be the maximum, and I&#39;m not sure if that would work that way I&#39;d want anyway)</li> <li>Find a way from my system to create a virtual super resolution. I haven&#39;t done this before on Linux.</li> </ul> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>System information:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Arch Linux 6.2.13-lts</li> <li>LG 24GN5W</li> <li>Mesa 23.0.3-1</li> <li>GNOME 43.5 Wayland</li> <li>AMD Radeon RX6650xt (which is billed as a 1080p card in contrast to the RX6700 which claims 1440p, but I think mine should work fine)</li> <li>Ryzen 7 5700x</li> <li>Asrock b460m</li> <li>OBS 29.0.2</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bobbytijuanalee"> /u/bobbytijuanalee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1330u3i/youtube_encoding1440pvirtual_super_resolutionobs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1330u3i/youtube_encoding1440pvirtual_super_resolutionobs/">[comments]</a></span>
