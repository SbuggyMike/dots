A ship carrying Ukrainian grain has left Odessa, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/grain-ship-leaves-ukraine-port-for-first-time-since-russia-blockade">bound for Lebanon</a>.

If Putin allows grain shipments to continue, that will be a great help
to many countries where people are suffering from hunger.

I previously suggested the idea that Ukraine could choke off Russia's
oil exports from Novorossiysk.  Back then, it would have been
retaliation in kind for what Putin was doing &mdash; but maybe he is no
longer doing that.
<p>
If Putin henceforth refrains from cutting off Ukraine's exports,
Ukraine should and must refrain from cutting off Russia's exports.
