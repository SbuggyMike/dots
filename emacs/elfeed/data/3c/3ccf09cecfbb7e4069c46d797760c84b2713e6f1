With this win, Gukesh has officially made into top 15 in the world in classical live ratings for the first time ever, going ahead of Mamedyarov, Dominguez and Abdusattorov.</p> <p>Another victory with white pieces came from the young GM Mishra who won against Jorden. Jorden has unfortunately one of the worst starts with two consecutive losses. It is worth noting that Mishra (who already had an advantage in midgame) played from move 32 to move 40 with only 30 seconds on clock (i.e. essentially played every move only with increments). Quite impressive that he was able to capitalise on his advantage during this phase where he was basically blitzing out moves.</p> <p>Then we had a match between the two veterans of the game where Svidler (with black pieces) defeated Gelfand. This unfortunately marks second consecutive loss for Gelfand, both coming with him playing with white pieces.</p> <p>Lastly, Grandelius also won with black pieces against Erigaisi. That makes 4 games won with black pieces in so far total of 8 games played in this tournament</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/glancesurreal"> /u/glancesurreal </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/6nywi9rcd3ya1.png">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/138w0am/updated_leaderboard_for_tepe_sigeman_and_co_chess/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
