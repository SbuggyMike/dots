California has passed a law that parodies the Texas law authorizing almost
anyone to sue whoever helps someone get an abortion.  California's law
does that same thing to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/22/new-california-gun-control-law-modeled-after-texas-anti-abortion-measure">people who do anything with illegal guns</a>.
Is this a good idea?

I think that the "anyone can sue you" approach to enforcing a law is
cruel and repressive, regardless of what actions are being prohibited.
Using this to enforce anti-gun laws is bad for the same reason
that using this to enforce anti-abortion laws is bad.
