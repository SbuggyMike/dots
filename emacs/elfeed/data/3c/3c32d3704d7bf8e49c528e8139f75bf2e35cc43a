<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m attempting to find a way to include org-roam into my workflow ATM. (I use Doom). It would be highly useful to be able to turn a word I am currently typing into an org-roam node. I understand that this functionality is provided by &#39;<em>org-roam-insert-immediate&#39;</em> <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/937">https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/937</a> however this facility is currently unavailable in the org-roam build I am using (i.e. the command is absent). How do I get this functionality as having to stop in order manually to create nodes whilst writing is very tedious? Thx a lot in advance..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PossibleFar5107"> /u/PossibleFar5107 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w7t0w1/no_orgroaminsertimmediate_command_available_in_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w7t0w1/no_orgroaminsertimmediate_command_available_in_my/">[comments]</a></span>
