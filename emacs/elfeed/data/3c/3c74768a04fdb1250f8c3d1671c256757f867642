<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/private-military-contractors-us-empire">The US hires mercenaries</a>
to fight in its wars, but it is hard to find out
how many.
  The mercenaries are lumped together with the contractors that only
cook and serve food, and the ones who work for the CIA or the State Department
are not listed.

A large fraction are not Americans, but rather hired in the countries
where military actions take place.
