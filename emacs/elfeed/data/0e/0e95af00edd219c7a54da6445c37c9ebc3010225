<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m a long time vimmer and having sparsely used spacemacs in the past and later doom emacs, have set out to write my own vanilla config.</p> <p>I’m trying to define leader based keybindings similar to doom and spacemacs with SPC as the leader.</p> <p>It seems that general.el is the preferred package for this. But I found that evil mode also presents evil-set-leader and allows for configuring prefix based commands. Further we can customize text for which-key prefixes which changes +prefix to +custom_text for instance.</p> <p>I’m considering setting up the entire leader based keymap with evil’s existing support. Is there any shortcomings to this? What can general provide me with that I cannot get with evil’s leader support? </p> <p>Appreciate any advice on this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/notthatfellow"> /u/notthatfellow </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12zyrnk/evilsetleader_vs_generalel_for_spc_based/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12zyrnk/evilsetleader_vs_generalel_for_spc_based/">[comments]</a></span>
