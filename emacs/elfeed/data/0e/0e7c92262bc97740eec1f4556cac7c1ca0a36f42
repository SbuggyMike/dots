<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Arch community !</p> <p>I’ve been going on my Arch adventure for a few months, going on a year soon enough, having a lot of fun.</p> <p>But i like to reinstall arch on a semi regular basis, maybe do a bit of distro hopping with gentoo and that kind of distro, trying different stuff to accumulate experience.</p> <p>Since i do distro hop and I’m tired of having to redo or download all my config files, i would like to partition my hard drive in 2 partitions. A root and a home. I did do it, it’s great for everything I’ve been doing since.</p> <p>Ive also been wanting to encrypt my hard drive. Hopefully fully. Ive found ways to do a full disk encryption but with one partition or multiple partition but only one encrypted.</p> <p>Does anyone have a tutorial or a wiki or tips to do a 2 partition, two encryption hard drive ? Or maybe a reason not to do it ? I’ve been looking on the internet on different wiki and forums and i don’t seem to find anything.. can anyone help ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Luckeysthebest"> /u/Luckeysthebest </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfwatf/how_to_encrypt_multiple_partitions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfwatf/how_to_encrypt_multiple_partitions/">[comments]</a></span>
