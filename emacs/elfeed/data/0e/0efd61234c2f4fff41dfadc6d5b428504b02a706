<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Having just paid untold amounts of money for a course, was not best pleased to see it does not even get me a repetoire tree etc, and more money has to be paid on top for pro membership.</p> <p>Was very reluctant to buy a course as knew deep down it was too expensive, have returned it as was annoyed they wanted more money to fully unlock all the features.</p> <p>Does anyone else consider chessable to be way too expensive? The videos on chessbase seem better value, and even most of those can be replaced with free content found on you tube.</p> <p>Have to wonder if they would make more money if they made their courses much cheaper, personally I would spend more money there if they were priced reasonably</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/344play"> /u/344play </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jdag2/chessable_should_scrap_pro_membership/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jdag2/chessable_should_scrap_pro_membership/">[comments]</a></span>
