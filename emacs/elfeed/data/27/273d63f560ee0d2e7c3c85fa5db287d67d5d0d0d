  US citizens: call on Biden to <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/tell-biden-seeking-asylum-legal-right">respect the legal right to ask for asylum</a>
inside the US.

Requiring asylum-seekers to run a nonfree program on top of that not
only fails to excuse the policy, it is an additional separate
injustice.  Governments must never require people to run a nonfree
program.
