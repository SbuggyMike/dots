<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, looking to use Anaconda Python in Emacs again. Several years ago I was using elpy and it was pretty simple to set up. Now following <a href="https://discourse.matplotlib.org/t/solved-figures-from-ipython-within-emacs-on-windows/20167">these</a> instructions, I include in my .emacs file:</p> <pre><code>(setq-custom python-shell-interpreter &quot;C:/ProgramData/Anaconda3/Scripts/jupyter.exe&quot;) (setq-custom python-shell-interpreter-args &quot;console --simple-prompt&quot;) (setq python-shell-completion-native-enable nil) </code></pre> <p>but then I get</p> <pre><code>Error executing Jupyter command &#39;console&#39;: [WinError 5] Access is denied </code></pre> <p>So I run Emacs in Administrator mode, but then I can&#39;t work with matplotlib.pyplot interactively because I think it&#39;s using a temporary graphics directory that is not anticipated by the Administrator account. </p> <p>Anyone know how to fix it, or have it working another way? Or I wonder if switching to eglot or lsp-mode is better. According to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20829308">this</a> post, it&#39;s better to stick with language modes in Emacs if they exist and use the language server only for those that don&#39;t.</p> <p><strong>Edit</strong> in case this isn&#39;t the case with everyone, using a regular python or ipython shell causes python to freeze when I generate plots wit the matplotlib.pyplot library.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chandaliergalaxy"> /u/chandaliergalaxy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wh97c2/emacs_and_python/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wh97c2/emacs_and_python/">[comments]</a></span>
