<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I have a certain situation here... I have IBus all set up and anthy as well to let me write Japanese, and basically everywhere it works fine and as expected.</p> <p>However, when I&#39;m in my terminal (I use Kitty), I no longer have the option to type in Japanese, even if my IBus was set to use Anthy, it just reverts itself to using english again.</p> <p>With minecraft, something even stranger happens: Not only can I not type in Japanese, but also the key combinations <sup>c</sup> <sup>v</sup> and <sup>a</sup> don&#39;t work, or rather, they don&#39;t do what they&#39;re supposed to.</p> <p>Let&#39;s say I&#39;m writing something in chat: <code>^a</code> deletes everything I&#39;ve written, but leaves an A in the chat line <code>^c</code> does copy stuff if I&#39;ve selected it with shift-arrows, and gets rid of it and types a c <code>^v</code> pastes what ever I have in my clipboard, and then also appends a v to it</p> <p>This also applies to things like the creative mode or JEI Search bars, basically anywhere I can input text.</p> <p>my ~/.xinitrc looks like this:</p> <p>``` export GTK_IM_MODULE=&#39;ibus&#39; export QT_IM_MODULE=&#39;ibus&#39; export XMODIFIERS=&#39;@im=ibus&#39;</p> <p>export $(dbus-launch) ibus-daemon -dr</p> <p>exec i3 ```</p> <p>Any ideas what I might be missing / doing wrong here?</p> <p>(Edit: Formatting)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GodlikeBlock"> /u/GodlikeBlock </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wio4y7/input_key_combinations_and_japanese_input_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wio4y7/input_key_combinations_and_japanese_input_in/">[comments]</a></span>
