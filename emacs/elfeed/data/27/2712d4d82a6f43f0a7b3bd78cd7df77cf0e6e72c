  Sea-level rise in the southern US has <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/sea-level-rise-and-hurricanes">accelerated</a>.  Since 2010 it is
rising more than a centimeter per year.

*A home purchased today in Pensacola will be underwater before the
 mortgage is paid off. This is so scary.*

This augments the damage done by hurricanes, but I think the sea-level
rise itself will do more damage, because it is cumulative.  Your
locality may go 50 years without a hurricane, but it won't go 50 years
magically skipped by sea-level rise.
