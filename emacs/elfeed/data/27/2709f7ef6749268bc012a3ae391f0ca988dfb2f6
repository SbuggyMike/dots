Pop! has consistently delivered over most others in terms of device support / driver compatibility, flawless install, versatility and overall satisfaction with the user experience. </p> <p>I have run into some problems with every other distro at least once or twice, yet Pop! has just been perfect without fail. </p> <p>inB4, I have no affiliation with the OS lol I just love it and wanted to see if others feel the same way. Also, if you’re looking for a great Ubuntu-based distro, I obviously highly recommend it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AndrewZabar"> /u/AndrewZabar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/133962l/anyone_else_love_pop_os_as_much_as_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/133962l/anyone_else_love_pop_os_as_much_as_me/">[comments]</a></span>
