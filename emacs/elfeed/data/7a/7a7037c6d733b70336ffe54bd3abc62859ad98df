  Guber <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jul/10/uber-bosses-told-staff-use-kill-switch-raids-stop-police-seeing-data">implemented
  a command (the "kill switch") to shut off access to its data base
  from headquarters computers</a>, so that government investigators
  couldn't determine whether the company was breaking taxi
  regulations.  The company used it in France, the Netherlands, India
  and Hungary, as well as Canada and Hong Kong.  The highest
  executives explicitly gave the command for this.  Even though they
  are no longer working for Guber, they should be prosecuted and
  punished for this crime.

  As for Uber, <a href="http://www.stallman.org/uber.html">let's
  punish it for all its wrongs</a> by not giving it our money.
