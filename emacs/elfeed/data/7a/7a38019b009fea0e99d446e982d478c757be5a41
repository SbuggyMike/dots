Three of them to be exact tempo, skeletons and expand. I’ve never actually dived into many of these features. After reading about them and experimenting with them deeper I have noticed how powerful they are. Aside from lack of documentation most of them are not used widely because they lack a good collection of snippets for various modes. This repo aims to give a good documentation and a set of snippets that could easily be copied by users to help them get started on using Emacs’ built in code templating and snippet tools.</p> <p>Feel free to add your own if have any that you use daily.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fromadarkcontinent"> /u/fromadarkcontinent </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wdbk34/emacss_native_templating_and_snippet_fuctionality/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wdbk34/emacss_native_templating_and_snippet_fuctionality/">[comments]</a></span>
