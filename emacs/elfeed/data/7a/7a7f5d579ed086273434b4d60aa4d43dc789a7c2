<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The bell/beep sound has been my arch nemesis ever since I started using Arch as my daily driver. Recently every time I shut down it beeps loudly. It also beeps loudly when using LightDM at startup.</p> <p>What I have done:</p> <ul> <li>setterm -blength 0 in /etc/profile</li> <li>set bell-style none in /etc/inputrc</li> <li>xset -b in /etc/xprofile</li> <li>greeter-setup-script=xset b off in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</li> </ul> <p>None of this helps.</p> <p>The wiki also suggests turning off your speaker or unloading the pcspkr module but I obviously want to use my speaker, I just don&#39;t want unneeded beep sounds.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deliverydo"> /u/deliverydo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wibtf1/how_to_actually_get_rid_of_the_beep_sound/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wibtf1/how_to_actually_get_rid_of_the_beep_sound/">[comments]</a></span>
