<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have ran Linux mint cinnamon edition from a partition on my ssd on my Acer aspire 3 with a Ryzen 5 3500u. I know Linux has a reputation for being power hungry, but I installed auto-cpufreq and all the cores of my CPU just remained at 1200mhz whilst browsing the web. The fans only occasionally kicked in lightly and when they did, I didn&#39;t even notice it as the 3500u barely went above 50C! This is such an improvement compared to windows where CPU usage spiked randomly as well as temps following suit, the fans would rapidly kick in loudly and my battery would be drained quickly. This is just a post of appreciation for Linux and I am now considering full time switching from Windows.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alizardloaf"> /u/Alizardloaf </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wb50dn/linux_mint_cinnamon_is_so_silent_on_my_laptop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wb50dn/linux_mint_cinnamon_is_so_silent_on_my_laptop/">[comments]</a></span>
