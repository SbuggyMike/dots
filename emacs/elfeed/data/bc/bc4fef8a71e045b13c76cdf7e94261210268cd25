I use Firefox with uBlock Origin as my primary browser.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been observing many posts/threads in subreddits like <a href="/r/FindMeADistro">r/FindMeADistro</a> where people want to get relatives, friends, parents, etc. to use Linux for their normal day to day tasks like surfing web, checking emails, watching photos and videos, etc. This limited use case is very common with the our senior citizens and old age users who might not feel comfortable getting everything done through applications on their smartphones. Another use case can be a home computer that anyone from the family can access to get small tasks done quick and easy. Or maybe you have a computer/laptop lying around that you do not intend to use much but it might come handy for a guest to check their emails.</p> <p>Be it having to install a Linux distribution for someone for such simple use cases or to put your unused computers/laptops to use, I have the most practical recommendation that would take stability, reliability and security as the top priorities. The reason I&#39;m calling it practical is because once you set this up, it would not require you to intervene every few months or years to fix issues or perform upgrades to new releases.</p> <p>Before getting down to the main part, let us set the expectations clear.</p> <blockquote> <p>What is this suggestion for? : </p> <p>A Personal Computer that is going to be used for very basic tasks like </p> <p>* Browsing </p> <p>* Emails </p> <p>* Multimedia </p> <p>* Documents </p> <p>* Writing </p> <p>by a Non-Tech Savvy user and you are required to get it ready for him/her/them.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you want to use it to be an all rounder and would use it for specific use cases like software development, audio/video production, gaming, graphics, etc. and are very much experienced with the Linux/GNU ecosystem and distributions or are willing to learn it, then this recommendation is not for you. You might want the latest and greatest. You might not like the idea of Flatpaks or Snaps. You might prefer distributions that provide huge number of packages in their software repositories.</p> <p>Moreover, this post does not take &quot;old&quot; hardware into consideration. So, if the targeted machine is under powered with 2GB RAM and/or a dual core CPU, then again, this post is not applicable. I&#39;ll explain the reason shortly.</p> <p><strong>Let&#39;s get started.</strong></p> <p>In my opinion, the discussed use case (expectations) does not require the availability of a lot of packages and also there is no need for them to be the latest and greatest. So, it is pretty clear that something &#39;fixed&#39; and &#39;static&#39; is going to be the best. Then why AlmaLinux? Why not something like Debian, Ubuntu or Linux Mint. Let&#39;s be clear about a simple fact. AlmaLinux is 1:1 clone of RHEL and is thus supported (security updates) for a total of 10 years. No other distribution that might come to your mind is going to live for that long. The whole point is to get others use Linux for their simple and limited day to day tasks without them getting to bother you time and again. Linux Mint might feel more intuitive and user friendly but the learning curve isn&#39;t very huge for the discussed use case. The time you spend initially showing them way around the distribution is going to be worth it.</p> <p>AlmaLinux being a 1:1 RHEL clone has it&#39;s own disadvantages. It does not come with multimedia codecs. No VLC in the official repositories. Which will leave the user with a terrible experience trying to watch videos if they choose to. The only DE in official repositories is GNOME. No KDE. No XFCE. No Cinnamon. No MATE. All this can be eliminated by using EPEL + RPMFusion third-party repositories with RHEL (and clones, thus AlmaLinux). This would allow us to install all the proprietary codecs and the KDE/XFCE as well.</p> <p>But, I choose not to recommend this way. These third party repositories do not come with the sort of commitment towards bug fixes/security patches that the original one&#39;s come with. After all, these are THIRD PARTY. The maximum we can do to make GNOME user friendly is go with the &#39;GNOME Classic (Xorg)&#39; session option that GDM provides on AlmaLinux Workstation install. Also, the fact that we are only left with GNOME is why I do not recommend to go with this install if the hardware is not capable enough to handle GNOME (Eg. &lt;4GB RAM, ancient dual core CPUs). For codecs and more packages, I would recommend adding flathub remote to flatpak and install Chrome, VLC and nomacs and remove EOG, Totem and other useless packages. Installing VLC from flathub will automatically install the open264 codec package. Also add uBlock origin extension to chrome so that your users won&#39;t be frustrated by advertisements.</p> <p>So, the typical steps would be:</p> <ol> <li>Download AlmaLinux 9 DVD ISO</li> <li>Install it with package selection as &quot;Workstation&quot;</li> <li>Choose &quot;Gnome Classic (Xorg)&quot; option from GDM session&#39;s Gear icon.</li> <li>Add FlatHub remote to Flatpak</li> <li>Install Chrome, VLC, nomacs</li> <li>Add uBlock Origin to GNOME</li> <li>Remove useless packages using dnf like eog, totem, cheese, GNOME Tour, etc.</li> <li>Add more Flatpaks if you need and change wallpaper to something that the intended user likes</li> </ol> <p>Show the way around to the user and tell them that they should open the &quot;Software&quot; store and check for updates as Flatpaks would be updated frequently and the base system would get bulk minor release updates every 6 months.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> AlmaLinux 9 comes with 10 years of support window which exceeds all the other distributions in the market. Essential flatpaks like CHrome, VLC and nomacs would compensate for the missing video/audio codecs. GNOME Classic (Xorg) session will prove to be intuitive and uBlock Origin extension takes care of the ads.</p> <p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Modified steps to add Point 3. &amp; 8.</p> <p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> Added the reason for why this post is not applicable for older under powered hardware - something similar to 2GB RAM &amp; an ancient dual core CPU.</p> <p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong> The installation discussed in this post used AlmaLinux 9 which was launched very recently. CentOS 7 on the contrary is almost 8 years old and will go EOL in June, 2024. To get an idea of what we can expect from such an installation (AlmaLinux 9) 8 years down the lane, I&#39;m going to set CentOS 7 up in a similar fashion as discussed in this post and share the review shortly. This is to test if latest flatpaks discussed in this post work without issues on an 8 year old distro or not.</p> <p><strong>EDIT 4:</strong> As per what <a href="/u/rklrkl64">u/rklrkl64</a> stated in the comments, it is true that chromium based browsers do not get installed on CentOS 6/7 since they require a later version of flatpak than what&#39;s available in CentOS 6/7. But other than that, Firefox, VLC and Nomacs work like breeze. Note that I installed fmpeg-full Flatpak as Firefox (Flatpak) uses it for video codecs. With this, one can opt for Firefox instead of Chrome as it might stay installable even after 8 years as per what we can see on CentOS 7 for now.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/na8l708mq4g91.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c701d65f4df07f7591d352d77a7bb86ac869aae6">CentOS 7 (GNOME Desktop) with GNOME Classic session &amp; Flatpaks (Firefox, VLC &amp; nomacs)</a></p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/0orv8f62r4g91.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b11384352d31e8e087f257d1344c2d51458f4da">List of Flatpaks installed</a></p> <p><strong>EDIT 5:</strong> I was thinking on this a lot lately and realized that for an inferior and old hardware that can not run GNOME, installing Debian with a lightweight DE like LXQt/XFCE (or others) makes most sense. The security support isn&#39;t as good as RHEL (and clones) but Debian LTS offering extends upto 5 years although not all packages in the archive enjoy the LTS support.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/itsmypc"> /u/itsmypc </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whktb1/almalinux_9_the_most_practical_install_that_you/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whktb1/almalinux_9_the_most_practical_install_that_you/">[comments]</a></span>
