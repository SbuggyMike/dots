<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><pre><code> I tried posting this to the classical resources sub but couldn&#39;t. Forgive me if this is inappropriate for this sub I have liked to occasionally listen to classical for many years, but I want to expand on my knowledge of what symphonies fit what moves me. Can name very few. While dramatic themes and sounds are not the only things I like, it is a good place to start. Wagner, particularly the ride of the valkyries, is about the style that I would like to hear recommendations on. I also frequently pull up the Eroica symphony as a go to.
