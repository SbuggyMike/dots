<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL;DR: I was recomended CentOs and I was curious what you guys thought about it. </p> <p>My grandfather was a computer wiz. He coded for the military, Atari and IBM back in the day, his preferred work machine was Redhat before he died. My main machine runs mint(no particular reason, just the first one I installed in highschool and what I tend to go back to after distri hopping). Before he died, he recommended I try CentOS since its “more or less free Redhat”. I never thought about it too much, but I’ve been thinking about him and wanted to give Cent a shot. I of course did some googling but I was curious what the community thought about Cent and Redhat.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ossified_swan"> /u/ossified_swan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vwycre/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_redhat_and_centos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vwycre/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_redhat_and_centos/">[comments]</a></span>
