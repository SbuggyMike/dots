The sole question about climate disaster supported the fossil fuel
companies' distraction campaign, <a href="https://stallman.org/archives//2021-may-aug.html#24_August_2021_(Carbon_footprint)">reducing one's own "carbon footprint"</a>,
rather than on the systematic state actions that they seek to prevent.

<a href="/glossary.html#global%20heating">global heating</a> disaster, it's clear that the best thing you can do is
<a href="/articles/children.html">avoid having children</a>.  Fewer humans in the future means humanity's
collective ecological footprint will be smaller in every dimension.

Reproducing at full speed, and letting the human population be reduced
by famine and war is the other alternative, and it's much worse.
