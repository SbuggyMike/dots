It was organized, directed, and hosted by Martin Thoresen until the end of Season 6; from Season 7 onward it has been organized by Chessdom. It is often regarded as the <em>Unofficial World Computer Chess Championship</em> because of its strong participant line-up and long time-control matches on high-end hardware, giving rise to very high-class chess.
