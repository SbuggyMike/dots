<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of my transients has recently changed behavior, and is very bothersome. Normally I would use it to choose a file from the project and then, with the transient menu staying open after visiting the file, I can press the another transient key and do that thing. But no more.</p> <p>Now, after visiting a file, it looks the same as before -- meaning, the transient stays open at the bottom of the screen -- but my cursor has now moved to the file itself and attempting to press one of the transient keys just inserts that character into the buffer, as if transient wasn&#39;t there. I then usually have to get rid of the inaccessible transient menu by calling another transient and cancelling it immediately, after which my screen has returned to full no-transient normal.</p> <p>Why would this one command be now causing my transient to lose focus without visibly exiting? The find-file or switch-to-buffer ones work just fine without any unexpected context changes: that is, the transient stays focused with them until I directly cancel it. </p> <p>Code:</p> <pre><code> (defun tsa/projectile (&amp;optional choose-project) &quot;Navigate the project files, possibly choosing project first&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (if choose-project (projectile-switch-project) (projectile-find-file))) ;; this is bound to &lt;f2&gt; (transient-define-prefix tsa/transient-window () &quot;Window navigation transient&quot; :transient-non-suffix &#39;transient--do-quit-one :transient-suffix &#39;transient--do-stay [[&quot;Switch&quot; (&quot;b&quot; &quot;buffer&quot; switch-to-buffer) (&quot;f&quot; &quot;find-file&quot; find-file) (&quot;g&quot; &quot;git-grep&quot; consult-git-grep) (&quot;p&quot; &quot;projectile&quot; tsa/projectile) ;; THIS one is the issue (&quot;F&quot; &quot;follow&quot; follow-mode) (&quot;a&quot; &quot;ace 1&quot; transient-ace-cmd)] ]) </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WorldsEndless"> /u/WorldsEndless </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w41f9j/error_one_of_my_transients_misplaces_cursor/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w41f9j/error_one_of_my_transients_misplaces_cursor/">[comments]</a></span>
