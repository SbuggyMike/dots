<p>Lots of people recommend Evil mode or switching to a Dvorak keyboard because it allows for more efficient editing. Evil mode <i>is</i> probably more efficient and, more importantly, helps with RSI problems. As a long term Vi/Vim user, those bindings were burned into my muscle memory and when I switched to Emacs and decided to use the vanilla keybindings, it was hard to give them up. Still, the default Emacs binding are also pretty efficient and the ability to easily implement my own editing commands more than makes for the loss of composability. The bottom line is that I’m pretty much agnostic concerning Evil mode.</p>
<p>Then there’s Dvorak and similar keyboard layouts. After suffering the pain of learning to touch type with QWERTY, I have no desire to start again for a possible gain of a few words a minute. I’m pretty efficient with QWERTY and if I needed to up my speed, there are plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ArVtCQqQRE">videos and tutorials to help with that</a>. The bottom line is that I’m not going to adopt some new keyboard layout and the associated pain for a small, putative increase in typing speed.</p>
<p>That brings us to <a href="https://susam.github.io/devil/">Devil Mode</a>. The idea is to get rid of the modifier keys while avoiding modal editing. To do that, the comma key is used instead of the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key so that you would open a file with <kbd>,</kbd> <kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>,</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd>. There are, of course, ways of dealing with the <kbd>Meta</kbd> modifier as well.</p>
<p>Your first question is, undoubtedly, how do you type a comma? The common cases of a comma followed by a <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> work normally but you can use <kbd>,</kbd> <kbd>,</kbd> for the edge cases. Follow the link for all the details.</p>
<p>If you really really want to eliminate the modifier keys without embracing modal editing, Devil Mode may be worth checking out. For me, it seems more like moving to Dvorak: whatever gain you might get isn’t worth the pain.</p>
