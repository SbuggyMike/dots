<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have start using <code>alists</code> then <code>plists</code> for managing some of my data in Emacs and they seem quite slow, especially with <code>plists</code>, but I&#39;m not sure where the delay is and I may be using it an inefficient manner.</p> <p>All I know is that for the small amounts of data involved it is not as fast as I expect, and in any case I expect my data to grow beyond its capabilities.</p> <p>Since <code>plists</code> and <code>JSON</code> look pretty much alike do guys think that managing the data with <code>JSON</code> may be a good idea? I was going to talk about redis but learned that redis doesn&#39;t use JSON as its native data format, but can use the JSON data format as well.</p> <p>Are there some external modules that Emacs can them with for better performance?</p> <p>How much data can <code>savehist</code> handle efficiently? I have a feeling I may be abusing it for something it is not intended for.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vfclists"> /u/vfclists </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wegkqo/plists_json_or_redis_for_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wegkqo/plists_json_or_redis_for_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
