<p>
Here's the text I gave as my personal message.
<p>
Please vote to enact the recommendations of the Special Commission on
Facial Recognition Technology. Those recommended rules will limit the
use of facial recognition by and for state government agencies so that
it does not become oppressive &mdash; presuming that the rules apply to all
jurisdictions that are part of the state. (I can't see an explicit
statement about that.)
<p>
However, this will certainly not be enough to protect us from the
repressive potential of facial recognition. Private companies can
also use facial recognition in ways that repress people. Imagine that
Amazon Ring joins forces with Clearview AI: it could track almost
everyone almost everywhere. It could report every person from Texas
that visits an abortion clinic in Massachusetts, for possible
prosecution in Texas. There are many other unjust possibilities.
Other methods of tracking, for instance through cellular phones, can
have the same effects.
<p>
To prevent tracking technology from threatening many human rights, we
need to legislate that it not be used in Massachusetts.
<p>
Thus, I urge you to follow the adoption of the commission's recommendations
about governmental use of facial recognition with strict limits on
private use of tracking technology.
