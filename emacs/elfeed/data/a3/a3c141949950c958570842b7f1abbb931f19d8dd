<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be honest, Linux can go several months without problems from memory leakage from running processes as it has been already proven when comparing it to other OSes like Windows. However, that&#39;s not really the main point of this post. I&#39;m curious to hear whether y&#39;all here leave your Linux desktop boxes in sleep (or hibernate?) mode overnight, and most most importantly, <strong>why</strong> if there are any specific advantages to doing this. I personally don&#39;t, but I&#39;d like to hear what y&#39;all have to say on this topic.</p> <p>I put &quot;desktop&quot; in asterisks because this would have obviously been a dumb question if I was asking for servers since they have to stay up 24/7 anyway.</p> <p>P.S. When I ask whether you leave it in sleep mode overnight I imply whether you generally don&#39;t shut it down overnight.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/G915wdcc142up"> /u/G915wdcc142up </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w70jl1/do_you_leave_your_linux_desktop_in_sleep_mode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w70jl1/do_you_leave_your_linux_desktop_in_sleep_mode/">[comments]</a></span>
