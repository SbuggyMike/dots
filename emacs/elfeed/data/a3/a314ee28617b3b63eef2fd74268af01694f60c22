Some time ago, one of the members of the Emacs-humanities mailing list mentioned a very specific problem. He wants to be able to replace all occurrences of the word at point with its upercase (or lowercase) variant. This is one of these things that can be solved with a bit of custom Elisp. Being a big fan of writing small (or sometimes not so small) helper functions to make editing easier, I offered to do a bit of coding to accomplish this task, and here it is. Being a teacher, I’d like to provide at least a short explanation, too. (Most of you probably know that I spent quite some time in 2021 doing exactly this – coding Elisp and explaining it – and the result is my book Hacking your way around in Emacs, designed as a “next step” after Robert J. Chassell’s excellent An introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp. Check out Chassell’s book if you are interested in learning Elisp, and then my book if you ant to go further!)
