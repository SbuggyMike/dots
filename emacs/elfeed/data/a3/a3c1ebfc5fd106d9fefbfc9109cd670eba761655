<p>This page is just for minor pointers on lesser studied languages that I
don't have enough to have on their own pages.</p>

<p>Gothic is a dead language and the only thing existing in it is a
partially translated New Testament by Wulfila. It still is a very
important language for the study of Germanic and Indo-Europeanism
because it is the only language of &quot;Eastern Germanic&quot; so well
attested. Eastern Germanic languages are distinct from other Germanic
languages in their lack of umlaut and some other characteristically
Germanic features, while Gothic still retains some earlier Indo-European
inflectional categories.</p>
<p>I mention Gothic only because one of the best ever language learning
books I've ever seen is written for it, and that is Thomas Lambdin's
<em>Introduction to the Gothic Language</em>. I actually took a Gothic class
flippantly in graduate school, but the book stuck out to me as being
perfectly designed for the typical target audience of Gothic in
historical linguistics.</p>
<p>The book has very well designed lessons and activities, but I think
greatest is that in the back of the book, for each chapter there is a
corresponding lesson on the historical grammar of the content learned.
It goes through what conjugates of each word exist in English, Latin,
Greek or Sanskrit or other Indo-European languages and provided
comparative paradigms of noun and verb inflections. No word or concept
is left without a <em>real</em> mneumonic device, not a fake one fake from some
joke about the word, but one tied into the actual historical facts of
the word.</p>
<p>I've said before that one of the reasons I never use things like <em>Anki</em>
and &quot;spaced repetition software&quot; is that the real way to retain
information is to understand how it fits within a wider web of
information. In historical linguistics, you have an ideal of this
because the more you learn, the easier it is to &quot;remember:&quot;
remembering that the Gothic word for &quot;field&quot; is <em>akrs</em> is incredibly
simple when you realize it's the same as Latin <em>ager</em>, Greek <em>agrós</em>,
Sanskrit <em>ájra</em> and English <em>acre</em>.</p>

<p>Sanskrit is the crown jewel of Indo-European languages and there are
very few resources for it. Luckily, there is <em>Devavanipravesika</em> by
Goldman and Sutherland, which again is a star in terms of language
books.</p>
<p>I do recommend you have some of these abilities before attempting
Sanskrit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some grammatical knowledge of a classical inflected Indo-European
language like Latin or Greek.</li>
<li>Knowledge of the Devanagari script which is used for Sanskrit
nowadays (also the script of Hindi and many other modern Indian
languages).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sandhi">Sandhi</h3>
<p>In English, if you say the sentence &quot;What are you up to?&quot; it usually
comes out closer to &quot;Whatchu up to?&quot; This kind of phonological
compression is a natural and systematic process in all languages. What
is interesting is that when written language was younger, it was very
common to express these phonological changes in the writing system
itself. It looks slangish in modern English to write &quot;whatchu,&quot; but it
is more accurate after all.</p>
<p>Sanskrit overtly writes every alternation like this, including when
words seem to combine together into a single prosodic word. The term for
this is [Sandhi]{.dfn}.</p>
<p>The tricky thing that newbies to Sanskrit must understand is that
knowing the principles of Sandhi are the first priority in knowing
Sanskrit because it's impossible to even parse a basic sentence before
you understand it. Phonemically, many Sanskrit words end in an -s, but
one of the first rules of Sandhi is that words <em>are not allowed to end
in -s in most cases</em>. So -s might show up as -h or -o or something else
depending on the phonetic context.</p>
<p>I say this because before you get excited about diving into Sanskrit,
you have to make sure you know the basics of Sandhi or it will all be a
mess.</p>

<p>Greek, much like Spanish, I never really sat down to learn. Greek is
close enough in form to Latin that I learned it from reading a biglottic
Bible in both languages. Its grammar presents very few concepts alien to
Latin, the only big hurdles probably being the novel uses of the article
and if you want to learn classical Greek like a pro, the pitch accent
system.</p>
<p>What I mean is that I only read very little of Greek grammar before I
could pick up my Latin-Greek Bible and start reading the Greek with the
aid of the parallel Latin. This was also a nice experience because you
can see the similaries between the two languages, but also how the
expressiveness of Greek is sometimes lost in translation.</p>
<p>Greek, for example, has such a complete and elegant paradigm of
participles that many of them are unstranlatable in Latin. Latin has
only passive perfect participles and active present participles, while
Greek has participles for the whole spectrum of voice, tense and aspect.
What that means is that Latin has to talk around some common Greek
expressions, often utilizing Latin deponents (which can have perfect
active participle) to get the meaning across.</p>
