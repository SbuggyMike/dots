<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m not sure how to post it on here as this community doesn’t allow picture posts apparently, but my political compass has dramatically changed in the last 6-8 years. </p> <p>I used to be middle right / right of centre back in like 2016/2017/2018/2019, but stuff in recent years has made me move ever more gradually to the left. </p> <p>I did my political compass yesterday for the first time in a while and I came out as closer to the far left than the centre - I’m a politics degree graduate so I have some pretty firm opinions on all the stuff they ask and I’m not just winging it. </p> <p>I also tend to follow more left wing voices nowadays and have unfollowed / unsubscribed from a lot of people on the right I used to watch back in the day, because I find their views nowadays as anything from slightly problematic to downright offensive and bigoted. </p> <p>I think current events have also played a role in my political realignment, as Trump has completely gone off the rails now (if he was ever on them) and the Government here in the UK has been, frankly, a disaster in recent years. </p> <p>I got to the point where I’d ask myself - am I really on the same side as these people? </p> <p>So I guess the question I’m asking is, has anybody else found themselves moving more to the left in recent years rather than to the right? At 26 years old, I wonder if many people go through the same thing?</p> <p>Edit: To those commenting that the political compass is useless and shouldn’t be taken seriously. I’m not suggesting they my entire interpretation here is based on my compass results. I know myself and I’ve recognised for some time that I’ve been going more to the left. I merely used the compass here as an indicator to reaffirm what I already knew and so that others could understand where I’m coming from better.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KharnTheBetrayer1997"> /u/KharnTheBetrayer1997 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/131mjlx/well_my_political_compass_has_changed_pretty/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/131mjlx/well_my_political_compass_has_changed_pretty/">[comments]</a></span>
