<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recent convert from Neovim to Emacs and am really enjoying working in Emacs.</p> <p>I have one little thing I have found to slow me down a little and wondering whether you guys had some suggestions.</p> <p>I used to have a buffer line with my current open buffers in Neovim and this allowed me to have 2-4 buffers/files in the bufferline that I was working on. It meant that I didn&#39;t have to think about which file I want to skip forward or back to - I would just look at the buffer line and then prev or next or wildcard to the buffer I want to skip to.</p> <p>In Emacs you do end up with a lot more open buffers so something similar wouldn&#39;t quite work but I wonder whether there are other solutions that might solve my issue. </p> <p>I would be perfectly happy to mark the buffers that I am currently working on for example and have them displayed somewhere for ease. Or have them pop up at the top of my buffer or ibuffer list so they are easy to see and select.</p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Two_Souls"> /u/Two_Souls </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vyhifo/currently_using_buffer_list/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vyhifo/currently_using_buffer_list/">[comments]</a></span>
