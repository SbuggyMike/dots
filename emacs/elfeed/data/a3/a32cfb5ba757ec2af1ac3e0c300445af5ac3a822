<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all! I&#39;m currently using vim, but I was having some serious issues and wanted to know if Emacs could save the day. I use a non QWERTY keyboard layout (rsthd), and that makes using vim TERRIBLE, so like any normal person I changed my vim bindings to my layout. This caused a lot of issues regarding combos, and when I asked the vim community they said changing the default keymappings is a bad idea and I should just learn the default ones on my layout. I wanted to know how hard configuring Emacs is with a custom layout, maybe I should just switch sides.</p> <p>Tl;dr how does Emacs handle changing default keybindngs compared to vim?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dobeye"> /u/dobeye </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb1qvo/customizing_emacs_bindings_for_custom_keyboard/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wb1qvo/customizing_emacs_bindings_for_custom_keyboard/">[comments]</a></span>
