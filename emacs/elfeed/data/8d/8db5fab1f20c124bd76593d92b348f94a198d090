<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is it possible to have an animated wallpaper in gnome? I know that there&#39;s a plugin that can do that in kde, but i like gnome. I don&#39;t necesarily need animated wallpaper, just something that has for example a falling rain effect on a fixed image.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lbr_crl"> /u/lbr_crl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vxz498/animated_wallpaper_on_gnome/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vxz498/animated_wallpaper_on_gnome/">[comments]</a></span>
