<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m migrating from Company to Corfu to try its integration with Orderless. I want to replace <code>M-i</code>, my &quot;invoke company manually&quot; key binding, with a trigger for Corfu.</p> <p>But I couldn&#39;t find a built-in function to invoke Corfu. It&#39;s usually triggered by TAB, but I prefer TAB to indent and never complete at the moment.</p> <p>I whipped up this hack by looking at how Corfu&#39;s UI is being triggered:</p> <pre><code>(defun ct/corfu-trigger () (interactive) (corfu--auto-complete (corfu--auto-tick))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-i&quot;) #&#39;ct/corfu-trigger) </code></pre> <p>It injects the auto tick so the internal equal check passes.</p> <p>I tried to bind to <code>completion-at-point</code> but even though that&#39;s what the TAB key (with the suggested configuration) is eventually calling, my bindings spawned the completions in the minibuffer instead of going through Corfu.</p> <p>What&#39;s a more elegant way?</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Was a configuration bug caused by myself. This works fine:</p> <pre><code>(global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-i&quot;) #&#39;completion-at-point) </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/divinedominion"> /u/divinedominion </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w561ba/better_key_binding_function_to_trigger_corfu/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w561ba/better_key_binding_function_to_trigger_corfu/">[comments]</a></span>
