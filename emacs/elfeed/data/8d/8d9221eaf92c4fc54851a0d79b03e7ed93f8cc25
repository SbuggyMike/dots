<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>How do you sync your text files/notes/logs across your devices i.e your work computer, home computer, laptop etc?</p> <p>Currently what I do is that:</p> <p>I put all of my notes, files and logs in a git repo on my desktop computer at home and push it to github and then I clone it on my work computer. Then if I make any changes there, I push it to github and then I pull the changes to my home computer.</p> <p>But this is creating so many unnecessary commits just to sync my files across the devices.</p> <p>Is there a more elegant way or a program? I hate google drive, the interface is really ugly an d slow and I can&#39;t sync them all easily and I can&#39;t use it from command line.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LowCom"> /u/LowCom </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w0zvq8/how_do_you_sync_your_text_filesnoteslogs_across/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w0zvq8/how_do_you_sync_your_text_filesnoteslogs_across/">[comments]</a></span>
