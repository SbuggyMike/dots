<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In general I will usually see two or three all-rounders being considered as the &quot;best ever&quot;. Those names are usually &quot;Sobers and Kallis&quot;, &quot;Sobers, Kallis and Imran&quot;, or sometimes, &quot;Imran and Sobers&quot;.</p> <p>Many people have Botham and Imran on more or less the same level, but because Imran is often talked about as being better than Botham, I have decided to use Botham, specifically, in this post.</p> <p>Kallis averaged 65 with the batt over 90 Tests between 1999 and 2007; scoring 27 hundreds and taking 191 wickets as well. I would assume it would have been some time in the mid-2000s when Kallis was beginning to be discussed as one of the very best ever.</p> <p>For overall career context:</p> <p>By the end of 2004, he had played 84 Tests, scored over 6000 runs at 54, scored 18 hundreds and taken 167 wickets.</p> <p>At the end of 2007, he&#39;d played 112 Tests, scored over 9000 runs at 58, 29 hundreds and taken 222 wickets.</p> <p>From your own memory of the time (if you were watching cricket back then), was it during around this period of time where he was beginning to be discussed in the same sentence as Botham, Imran, or even Sobers?</p> <p>Once he&#39;d been established as one of the greatest ever, then the next thing that could have happened was the discussion of if he was even better than &#39;that&#39;; if Kallis was better than any of these greats, and if he was near the level of the great Gary Sobers.</p> <p>Personally, I don&#39;t recall this conversation happening; not really. But what I do remember is his &#39;comeback&#39;, or &#39;return to form&#39; that lasted from 2009 to 2012. Kallis had an uptick in production after a short career slump. I seem to remember people talking about him becoming &#39;greater&#39; during this time (in terms of overall career / &#39;greatness&#39;), and then maybe by around 2011/2012 people were wondering whether he might actually be the greatest all rounder of all time.</p> <p>What do you remember about this conversation?</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Side note:</p> <p>I also remember the incredible hype around Dale Steyn from 2008 onwards. Then by maybe 2010/2011 people were questioning whether he could be the greatest fast bowler ever.</p> <p>That doesn&#39;t mean he was (or even top 5) at that stage, but his incredible talent and performances opened the conversation up.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MonkSalad1"> /u/MonkSalad1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w7iiop/at_what_point_during_his_career_did_kallis_start/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w7iiop/at_what_point_during_his_career_did_kallis_start/">[comments]</a></span>
