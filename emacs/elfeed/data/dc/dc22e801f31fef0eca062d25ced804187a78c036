Ukraine wants to put Putin and his high officials <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/ukraine-calls-for-international-tribunal-to-bring-putin-to-justice-more-quickly">on trial for war
crimes</a>.

the war simply to prevent that, even if he has no chance of actually
winning.

However, if there is no chance of bringing him to justice, the trial
is just a futile display of anger.
