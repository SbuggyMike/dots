<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since most of us are now aware that the public is being absolutely railed by Energy companies, Petrol, etc. whilst simultaneously publicly posting huge profits, I would like to see some discussion on what people here think should be done, if anything.</p> <p>Our representatives show no sign of doing what we think should be done. When our representatives no longer represent our interests I believe it is time to represent ourselves.</p> <p>I recently saw a video of a brave chap deciding exactly how much he is willing to pay for petrol and only paying that amount. Proudly stating that he is willing to be taken to court for the remainder of the bill. Is this the way forward?</p> <p>I&#39;m honestly interested in your thoughts, please share them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fingerless-Thief"> /u/Fingerless-Thief </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/wcx68w/do_you_think_we_might_see_a_repeat_of_the_poll/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/wcx68w/do_you_think_we_might_see_a_repeat_of_the_poll/">[comments]</a></span>
