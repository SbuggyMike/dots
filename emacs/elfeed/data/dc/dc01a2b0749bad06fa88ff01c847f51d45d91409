<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Everytime I shutdown/reboot my computer, my Chromium dies (asks me if I want to restore the last session) so I&#39;ve been trying to set up a shutdown script which gracefully kills it instead. I&#39;ve read some guides online with the usual <code>Before=shutdown.target</code> etc but I can&#39;t get it to work. Can someone please post a service file which works for them?</p> <p>My current theory is that Arch shuts down &quot;too fast&quot;. I have used Linux Desktops before, and although their shutdown was way faster than Windows&#39;, it wasn&#39;t quite as instantaneous as it is now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BrokenCommander"> /u/BrokenCommander </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vy88ja/shutting_down_too_fast/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vy88ja/shutting_down_too_fast/">[comments]</a></span>
