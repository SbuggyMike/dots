Senator Feinstein is ill and unable to go to the Senate to vote.
This is blocking many judicial appointments.  She agreed to let
another Democrat replace her on the judiciary committee,
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/durbin-blue-slip-norm">so as to unblock these votes</a>,
but Republicans' assent was required and some refused.
<p>
It is absurd for Senator Durbin to defend a questionable bipartisan
tradition of the past that the Republicans refused to observe when the
<a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#s-i-c">saboteur in chief</a> was president.  To defend it unilaterally is being a
sucker.
