<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Linux is awesome, I was running the latest LTS of Ubuntu and I started to install all my go to programs, minecraft, discord, slack, etc. Then eventually I wanted to instsll roblox and curseforge. Roblox doesn&#39;t support linux, and curseforge only allowes for any games asides from World of Warcraft. After thinking for a while, I figured out I&#39;d rather simply use windows instead of running thousands of 3rd party tools to simply play a game and have it lag my entire PC (I&#39;m looking at you grapejuice), linux is overall faster and better, but Windows is so much easier to use and has more programs. If roblox and curseforge ever fully support linux, I&#39;d jump to change back, but for now it&#39;s improbable for mr to sacrafice two of my most used platforms for better preformance.</p> <p>I&#39;ll probably return to linux later down the line. If anyone knows an OS that has the user ease of Windows alongside the compatibility of Windows but the speed of linux, please comment it or send me a DM containing the name of the OS</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Calm-Ad-6803"> /u/Calm-Ad-6803 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whhn9o/im_sorry_but_i_cant_use_linux_let_me_explain/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/whhn9o/im_sorry_but_i_cant_use_linux_let_me_explain/">[comments]</a></span>
