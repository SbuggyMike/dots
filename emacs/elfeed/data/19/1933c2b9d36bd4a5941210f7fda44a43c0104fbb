<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This would be aimed at players around my lower elo (1100 to 1500) this is particularly aimed at players that play traps like the scholars mate ever game or something similar, what enjoyment do you get out of playing these positions?</p> <p>Sorry I know this comes across as judgemental but from my perspective if the trap works, all it means is the player doesn&#39;t know the trap, if it doesn&#39;t you end up in a worse position. It doesn&#39;t in my humble opinion seem like a fun way to play chess, and if it does work it just a series of memorized moves that end the game. </p> <p>Does anyone else feel this way? Obviously in higher elos they become pointless as all the good players know them</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Maleficent_Wing_6381"> /u/Maleficent_Wing_6381 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w7iy0z/a_question_to_players_who_play_opening_traps/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w7iy0z/a_question_to_players_who_play_opening_traps/">[comments]</a></span>
