<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I feel like often we treat composers&#39; styles and works as &quot;sacred&quot; and &quot;unquestionable,&quot; and are often afraid to suggest ways in which you think they could be changed/improved, beyond a little ornamentation (unless you&#39;re Horowitz). So go ahead- what things would you personally change about composers&#39; works (either specific works or general aesthetic?).</p> <p>For example, I love Beethoven PC 5, but the transition between the 2nd and 3rd movement always feels weird and forced to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/opus52"> /u/opus52 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8pu0w/improvements_youd_suggest_to_different/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8pu0w/improvements_youd_suggest_to_different/">[comments]</a></span>
