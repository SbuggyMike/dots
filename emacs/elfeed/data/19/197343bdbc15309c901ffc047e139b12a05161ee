<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just installed Arch on my main alongside Windows 11 but I can&#39;t get Bluetooth to work. I have bluedevil installed (I&#39;m using KDE Plasma) but whenever I open it and try to connect my headphones, nothing shows. I&#39;ve tried downloading my drivers but that didn&#39;t help. I can&#39;t use my computer without bluetooth, since I use bluetooth headphones. Anyone know how to get my Bluetooth working?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lost-Entrepreneur439"> /u/Lost-Entrepreneur439 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0yly1/i_cant_use_my_bluetooth_in_arch_anyone_know_how/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w0yly1/i_cant_use_my_bluetooth_in_arch_anyone_know_how/">[comments]</a></span>
