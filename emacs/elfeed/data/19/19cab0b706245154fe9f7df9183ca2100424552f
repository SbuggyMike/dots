<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all. Let me preface this by saying I ran two main Linux machines: a Ubuntu one and a Fedora one. I tend to favor Ubuntu for Nvidia setups due to their straightforward compatibility with Secure Boot. Secure Boot under Ubuntu is just a breeze. On Fedora, though, you must do some small stuff that it&#39;s not too much of a bother but that I&#39;d rather not do. Because of this, I always preferred Ubuntu. I had to change to Fedora, though, to the lack of maintenance on many Ubuntu packages.</p> <p>Let&#39;s take <a href="https://pkgs.org/download/lutris">Lutris</a> for example. The latest version of Ubuntu has in its repos currently an older version than Fedora 35, which was released in 2021!.</p> <p>The same happens with <a href="https://pkgs.org/search/?q=vlc">VLC</a> or <a href="https://pkgs.org/download/rhythmbox">Rhythmbox</a> (the difference is minor, but it&#39;s there), <a href="https://pkgs.org/download/libreoffice">Libreoffice</a> (you only get the latest versions if you use a 3rd party repo, and let&#39;s not even talk about Ubuntu 20.04 which still runs LO 6.4, and we are on 7.3), <a href="https://pkgs.org/download/gcc">gcc</a> and let&#39;s not even talk about <a href="https://pkgs.org/search/?q=touchegg">Touchegg</a> (this one is just ridiculous, Ubuntu still ships a release from 2011!).</p> <p>I seriously cannot understand how a community-led project such as Fedora (granted, it&#39;s with Redhat funding, but still community led) has a much more up to date repository on a release from 2021 than Ubuntu does in its latest release.</p> <p>What&#39;s left for Ubuntu? Showcases of robots and a nice theming? It&#39;s just sad.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jorgesgk"> /u/jorgesgk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w8uqin/dissapointed_by_the_outdated_state_of_ubuntu/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w8uqin/dissapointed_by_the_outdated_state_of_ubuntu/">[comments]</a></span>
