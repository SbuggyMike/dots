<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using the option key on my Mac to enter accented characters and Umlauts. I do this system-wide, with an ANSI QWERTY keyboard.</p> <p>Now in Emacs, there&#39;s plenty of ways to get to an <code>ü</code>. There are modes which let you enter <code>&quot;u</code>, for example.</p> <p>I ponder binding my Meta key to the option key ⌥; it&#39;s currently bound to Cmd ⌘ so I have the ability to enter umlauts easily. (But given how little I need that in Emacs, since all my writing there is in English, I might as well switch and then have nicer key bindings.)</p> <p>Which modes do you personally prefer to use for this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/divinedominion"> /u/divinedominion </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w97aur/whats_your_personal_preference_to_write_äöüß_etc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w97aur/whats_your_personal_preference_to_write_äöüß_etc/">[comments]</a></span>
