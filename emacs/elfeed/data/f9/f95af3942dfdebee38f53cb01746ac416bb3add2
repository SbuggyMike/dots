Amazon is harassing warehouse employees with pressure <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alb-1-anti-union-signage-alu-004207814.html">not to vote
to unionize</a>.
<p>
Workers at a Chipotle outlet filed for union recognition, so the
company <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/business/chipotle-union-store-closure/index.html">shut that branch permanently</a>.
<p>
The article sates that since mid-June the branch has been open "only
for staff trainings".  I have a hunch that these "trainings" are
actually union-busting harassment meetings.  This is a standard tactic
used by many companies to fight union organizing.  They order workers
to listen for hours to the propaganda of union-busting consultants,
and perhaps to answer their questions too.

It could be useful training &hellip; in how to stand firm against the man.

Do you feel like eating Chipotle's food after reading this?
