<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I am using emacs 28 on Windows 10, and since 1 week or two, I sometimes get a message in a Windows window indicating that emacs is crashing, and offering to debug or not.</p> <blockquote> <p>emacs is crashing, would you like to open a Debugger?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/vg4GLXZmLP9q">https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/vg4GLXZmLP9q</a></p> <p>When I choose to debug, a stacktrace is written in a locally saved txt file. Why this message and not a warning within emacs (debug on error is set to true) ?</p> <p>How can I get rid of it? Thanks for your help,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fmou67"> /u/fmou67 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jh5bk/what_is_this_warning_i_get_regarding_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13jh5bk/what_is_this_warning_i_get_regarding_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
