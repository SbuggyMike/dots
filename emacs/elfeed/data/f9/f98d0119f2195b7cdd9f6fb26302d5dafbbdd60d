<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I&#39;m new to Arch Linux. I started downloading Waterfox from yay, and it took forever for compilation, and mainly it was taking heck lot of installation space. I decided to Ctrl+c it and move on. I checked my hard disk space and it was 106GB initially and it had become 100GB, so the 6GB went away! So I&#39;m tried to find solutions online, got some answers like &#39;yay -Qm, then yay -Sc&#39; did all that, but not luck. It was only able to remove a small fraction. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Need some assistance here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Content-Value-6912"> /u/Content-Value-6912 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/133fpwe/how_can_i_remove_the_half_compiled_i_guess/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/133fpwe/how_can_i_remove_the_half_compiled_i_guess/">[comments]</a></span>
