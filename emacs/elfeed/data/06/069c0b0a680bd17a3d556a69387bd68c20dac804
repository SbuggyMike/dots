Anything for the team, I have been a team player. Really happy. Mohsin has a really big heart. When you have a big heart you go a long way. He was injured for the last year. He went through a big surgery. But he did well. He has a big heart and the sky is the limit. It has not been easy for us. Though we have played some good cricket, the results haven&#39;t been in our favour. Fans have supported us and good to give them a win.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Marcus Stoinis, player of the match</strong>: &quot;[On the final over] Great moment for Mohsin. He had been injured since the last IPL. To come into the game and the bowl the final over was great. It was very close. There&#39;s a long little things that go your way. We bowled okay to keep us in the game and a couple of good overs by the spinners and Mohsin in the end. We&#39;ve shown over the last two years that there&#39;s no superstars winning games. Different people contributing for our wins. We are missing KL through injury but other people are standing up. KP is leading us well. GG and Andy have been superb as well.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai captain</strong>: &quot;We just lost the game. We didn&#39;t play well enough to win. There were moments we didn&#39;t win. Unfortunate but we need to keep our heads high. [On fast start] We assessed the pitch well, it wasn&#39;t a pitch like the earlier one. It was good to bat on. But we lost our way in the second half. In hindsight, we gave away too many runs at the back end. The last three overs went for a few. The way we had started, we were in a good position to chase that target. [Stoinis] Played according to his strength. Kept hitting down the ground, which is what you have to do on that pitch. [Qualification] I don&#39;t know how the calculation works. We have to come out and win that game.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Mohsin Khan</strong>: &quot;[Last over] My aim was to execute what I used to practice and back my strength. I told Krunal I will bowl what I was always trying. My run-up wasn&#39;t short, even though I felt so. I was trying to keep myself calm and not look at the scorecard. My aim was to bowl six balls and not look at how much was required. I was trying to bowl the slower ball but the batter was trying to hit big and was getting beaten. I was going for the yorker and was changing as per the batter. I am playing after one year. I was injured and it was a tough time. I am happy to bowl and my father was in the hospital in the ICU and he was discharged yesterday and I am hoping he is watching. Today I played for my father. He was hospitalised and is out now. Thanks to the team and support staff for having faith in me.&quot;</p> <p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=poochi&amp;subject=Bot%20Feedback"><sup>Send feedback</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_schedule"><sup>Schedule</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_help"><sup>Stat Help</sup></a></p> <p><sup>Please don&#39;t post illegal streaming links in match threads</sup></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CricketMatchBot"> /u/CricketMatchBot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/13jcime/post_match_thread_lucknow_super_giants_vs_mumbai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/13jcime/post_match_thread_lucknow_super_giants_vs_mumbai/">[comments]</a></span>
