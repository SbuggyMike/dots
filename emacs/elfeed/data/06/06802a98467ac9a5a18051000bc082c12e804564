<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The most recent comparisons I could find were from 2011. I&#39;m wondering if anyone knows how what the breakdown between GNU/Linux kernel/Gnome Desktop/other software is (I&#39;m thinking that people might or might not consider Gnome as GNU these days, so splitting them is an easy way to appease everyone, hopefully). </p> <p>Old figures I found online, which are from 2011, and when the Linux kernel was under 10 million lines of code. Whereas it&#39;s at about 30 million today.</p> <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604112035/http://pedrocr.net/text/how-much-gnu-in-gnu-linux">https://web.archive.org/web/20110604112035/http://pedrocr.net/text/how-much-gnu-in-gnu-linux</a></p> <p>Yes, I know Lines of code is a potentially flawed metric. I&#39;m open to other methodology, but would still like the answer to this question either way</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thefanum"> /u/thefanum </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/we2nz0/how_much_gnu_is_in_a_modern_linux_os_like_ubuntu/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/we2nz0/how_much_gnu_is_in_a_modern_linux_os_like_ubuntu/">[comments]</a></span>
