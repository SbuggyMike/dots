<p>I'm going to probably be doing a test livestream in a bit. Hopefully I
fixed the issue in the previous stream with Pulseaudio and buffering.</p>
<p>I'll probably go live on PeerTube first, test it there, then test it on
YouTube. I'm mobile and on limit battery though, so it won't be a
super long stream if everything works out.</p>
<p>PeerTube stream will be at this link:
