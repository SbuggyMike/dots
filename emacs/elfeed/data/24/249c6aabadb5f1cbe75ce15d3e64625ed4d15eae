<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There&#39;re 2 mainline WM called Stacking and Tilling. Dynamic should be somewhere 40% stacking +60% tiling. I don&#39;t wanna confuse what type is better, it totally depended on your workflow and your distro. </p> <p>But, there&#39;s a kind of Stacking Window Manager I could not understand why it still exists and still be maintained today. I call them lightweight WM when they focus on speedup pc usage. Some of names are IceWM, Openbox, Fluxbox, JWM, FVWM... To me, they look super ugly, sometimes stupid buggy. They are not friendly to new users when missing many functions and not many documents, or could someone tell me that you started Linux with something not fully DE like Gnome, KDE, XFCE, Cinnamon...? Even if you&#39;re the type of DarkSoul player, you can start with i3, awesome, xmonad, sway. Almost tiling WM has many guides. Look back lite version of stacking WM, you see they work like normal stacking but you still need to edit config in text file. And they don&#39;t optimize hardware performance too good to say that they&#39;re really lite when compare to tiling WM. So they don&#39;t have any selling point IRL&gt;</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>What should be right? In my thought, these lightweight WMs only are built in two ways either C or C++. Why? why would they don&#39;t work with each other to make somewhat ( and call it LiteDE or whatever)? Do they have personal matter with each other? Their WM don&#39;t have any special function to make separate versions ( like PopOS they made Pop shell, definitely different to gnome&#39;s mutter). Only two lite stacking WMs should exist in my opinion. They&#39;re Openbox and Labwc. And why? Because Openbox is using as main WM in a bigger full DE (LXqt), and labwc will do openbox&#39;s job in wayland. That&#39;s all and enough. I wanna shout out directly to Enlightenment. They should not exist, too. Idk what if anyone can use E25 today in a official distro as daily usage, not for testing purposes. Till Budgie 11 is something beta, E made me a super big question mask about their exist in ideal Utopia, not for practical human.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wooden_Put_1827"> /u/Wooden_Put_1827 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w53v2o/explain_to_me_why_lightweight_stacking_window/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w53v2o/explain_to_me_why_lightweight_stacking_window/">[comments]</a></span>
