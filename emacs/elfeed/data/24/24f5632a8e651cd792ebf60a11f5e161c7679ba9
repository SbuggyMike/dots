<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I install arch linux with archinstall on virtualbox and I am new to linux. I installed deepin for the Desktop, and the start menu (Launcher it’s called) just flashes when I click on it. I turned it off and on and I really don’t want to install arch again. Can y’all help me fix it? I got it to work once and never again</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mysterious-Dig2841"> /u/Mysterious-Dig2841 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1332r8l/deepin_start_menu_flashes_when_clicked_on_start/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1332r8l/deepin_start_menu_flashes_when_clicked_on_start/">[comments]</a></span>
