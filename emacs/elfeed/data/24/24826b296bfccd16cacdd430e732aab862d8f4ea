<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically to install a key &quot;properly&quot; one has to do something like <code> if ! grep &quot;$(curl https://key)&quot; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; then curl https://key &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys fi </code> but this is so difficult that in practice people just do <code> curl https://key &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys </code> and duplicate keys gets installed sometimes.. and then there&#39;s the issue of WHY a key is installed.. all of this could be avoided if we could just do a <code> curl https://key &gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.d/pingdom_key </code> - 0 chance of duplicates - trivial to see that &quot;oh this is the pingdom key&quot; - easy to remove, even programmatically: <code>rm ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.d/pingdom_key</code></p> <p>instead we have to dick around with ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ... why? :(</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Takeoded"> /u/Takeoded </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/138dtub/why_isnt_sshauthorized_keysd_a_thing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/138dtub/why_isnt_sshauthorized_keysd_a_thing/">[comments]</a></span>
