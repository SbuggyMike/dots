<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Suppose you have two terminal windows open; in one of them, you&#39;ve laboriously cd&#39;d into a path that&#39;s like 10 folders deep and none of them were tab-completion friendly and you really don&#39;t want to do it again.</p> <p>Now you want to access that same path from the other terminal, in which you&#39;re just sitting in your homedir.</p> <p>In the deep-in-folders terminal:</p> <pre><code>echo $$ </code></pre> <p>That prints the shell&#39;s own PID (process ID), which will be a number like &quot;12467&quot;.</p> <p>Now in the other one, all you need to do to jump directly into the same working folder is:</p> <pre><code>cd /proc/12467/cwd </code></pre> <p>Some points:</p> <ul> <li><p>If you want to go up from there and not land in /proc , you can either do a <code>cd -P .</code> after you arrive, or put the <code>-P</code> into the command above - note that <code>-P</code> has to come before the path. (<strong>Edit:</strong> After some playing around, I think bash has some issues with symlinks and cd. So, I&#39;ll add a caution: pay attention when using <code>cd</code> or <code>cd -P</code> across links, especially dynamically generated ones like those in /proc, and make sure you land where you expected.)</p></li> <li><p>You can of course also use this to do other stuff; e.g. copy files back and forth - <code>cp &quot;here other shell, have this file&quot; /proc/12467/cwd/</code> will work as expected, as will <code>cp /proc/12467/cwd/&quot;file you just made in the other shell.txt&quot; ./&quot;give it here&quot;</code>.</p></li> <li><p>For extra fun and games, I&#39;m thinking of tweaking my tmux and shell configs so that when I&#39;m in a tmux session, each pane displays its name in PS1 or the status bar, and has an auto-updated symlink to its working dir; then I can just reference each pane&#39;s working dir at a glance with something short like, I dunno, <code>~/l/3/</code></p></li> <li><p>I completely expect there to be a much better way of doing this that I just haven&#39;t thought of. Looking forward to the &quot;but why don&#39;t you just ...&quot; :)</p></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/will_try_not_to"> /u/will_try_not_to </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12z8ws7/stupid_linux_tricks_cd_one_shell_to_the_current/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12z8ws7/stupid_linux_tricks_cd_one_shell_to_the_current/">[comments]</a></span>
