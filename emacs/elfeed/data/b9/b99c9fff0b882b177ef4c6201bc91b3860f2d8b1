<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve used Arch Linux for about 10 years. I recently started a job where I can use Linux on my laptop. I tried some slower moving distro&#39;s like Debian, NixOS and Fedora. But it really lacks the customization I want. So to prevent surprise breakage on updates I decided to update only on Friday afternoon. So if anything breaks I have some time to fix it. Which in my experience doesn&#39;t happen that much anymore these days.</p> <p>There&#39;s only one scenario I have no solution for yet: If during the week I need to install something, I also need to update the entire system, because partial upgrades aren&#39;t supported.</p> <p>I&#39;m already using distrobox for my development toolchains so I have freedom to update anything in those distroboxes.</p> <p>Any other tricks to avoid this problem?</p> <p>EDIT: Maybe &quot;surprise breakage&quot; is not the best description. Maybe &quot;unexpected maintenance&quot; is a better description.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/starquake64"> /u/starquake64 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13j0jye/preventing_surprise_breakage_caused_by_an_update/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13j0jye/preventing_surprise_breakage_caused_by_an_update/">[comments]</a></span>
