<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>EDIT: A little update if anyone is interested, just installed EndeavourOS on my Asus ZenBook UM425. Only a couple of minor &quot;gotchas&quot;, if I wanted the touchpad&#39;s number pad to work I needed to pull a daemon from someone&#39;s github and install it. Keyboard had a little trouble but only required adding a kernel parameter to fix. Fn key starts off locked to &quot;on,&quot; haven&#39;t decided if I care yet. Ultimately a much better experience. Everything works. Microsoft isn&#39;t looking over my shoulder unless I run Edge (And that&#39;s for my work account so my company&#39;s already looking over my shoulder when I use it anyway). Guess the C930 will be relegated to a Windows streaming client, at least it&#39;s got the audio for it. I&#39;ll do my real work on the Asus.</p> <p>ORIGINAL POST:</p> <p>I&#39;ve been fighting with this thing for a month. It&#39;s possible to get partially working, but it may also be an example of how some manufacturers really don&#39;t want you to have options. So, imitating Gary Sims, &quot;Lemee explain.&quot;</p> <p>First off, the BIOS is wierd. Lenovo already has this wierd thing where you have to hold down Fn while pressing the power button to get a boot menu. Ok, fine, eventually that gets found and figured out. Besides, the hardware is pretty nice, audio is great, webcam with a sliding cover instead of tape, touchscreen, worth a little effort, right?</p> <p>Little, hah.</p> <p>Next thing you find out is thaty the device is very picky about what it&#39;ll boot to. MBR Ventoy won&#39;t work. YOu have to use a UEFI/GPT Ventoy, or an MBR Yumi. Or just use Rufus or a similar tool to set it up. Ok, back to the Windows machine to re-burn a new USB stick, allrighty. Can&#39;t be much more to go wrong, right?</p> <p>Wrong.</p> <p>Ok, so we&#39;re into a Linux. Not gonna broadcast which one but I&#39;m sure it can be guessed. But it&#39;s not the point of the story. There&#39;s no audio. Off to Google I go...audio is only &quot;partially supported.&quot; Well, not the end of the world...but it&#39;s supposed to work on install. Oh wait, not anymore, Google says now...there&#39;s a few additional config files that need to be created to force it to detect. Ok, good enough....but that&#39;s only the L and R channels. Center channel is enabled through a different workaround, which had to be installed from a specific repo. Ok fine. And no subwoofer anymore. Sound is a little tinny because of that but it still sounds OK. I guess maybe I can put up with it, I haven&#39;t thrown it through the window yet. So we&#39;re good, right?</p> <p>Heh.</p> <p>The webcam. It supposedly works 100%. And it does...sort of. As long as you&#39;re not using anything Chrome-based. For some reason Chrome, Edge, Chromium, and anything Electron-based can only see the webcam when, get this, the laptop is plugged into a USB-C docking station. Unplug the dock, and it goes away. Oops. So I try a different distro (different based one too). Same deal. No one can figure out why. Except maybe Lenovo. Who doesn&#39;t care.</p> <p>So, the solution? Go back to my Windows machine, burn a non-Ventoy USB Windows boot, reinstall Windows, and pawn the machine off on a family member who will never use Linux.</p> <p>Save yourself from pulling out giant patches of hair. If you see one of these things, walk right past it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/npaladin2000"> /u/npaladin2000 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wb3wdv/tip_do_not_install_linux_on_a_lenovo_c930_glass/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wb3wdv/tip_do_not_install_linux_on_a_lenovo_c930_glass/">[comments]</a></span>
