<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sport is, first of all, a struggle with oneself. Especially when you have already reached the top. It is a mistake to believe that people leave the sport because they are afraid of competition. It is believed that everyone only thinks about how to leave undefeated, not fall from the throne and not disappoint the viewer. All this is nonsense. Over time, there will always be someone who is faster, higher, stronger. Especially in those sports that require a lot of physical activity. It is impossible to show the same results at twenty and at forty. But they leave not for this reason, but only because everyone has already proved to themselves, overcome themselves, coped with themselves, and not with a string of rivals.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fate_is_quickening"> /u/fate_is_quickening </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w7s0vl/an_interesting_thought_from_karpov_about/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w7s0vl/an_interesting_thought_from_karpov_about/">[comments]</a></span>
