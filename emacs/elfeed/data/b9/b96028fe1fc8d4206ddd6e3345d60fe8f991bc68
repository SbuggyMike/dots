<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have tried everything but i cannot autostart a script in dwm all i wanna do is put nitrogen --restore command so it runs at startup so i dont have to change the wallpaper everytime i login so i put it in .xinitrc .bash_profile and even in .bashrc it didnt work so then i made a script to run this command used chmod +x /home/user/filename.sh to make it executable used crontab -e to set it for user and root doesnt work so i thought lets try a simple command to execute terminal at startup then deleted the previous .sh file made a new one just in case followed all the steps still doesn&#39;t work even though when i run the script it runs fine and even those commands run fine on the terminal but cannot make an autostart file to run it on startup any help on what am i doing wrong.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AwabKhan"> /u/AwabKhan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7nj2m/i_cannot_autostart_a_script_in_dwm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7nj2m/i_cannot_autostart_a_script_in_dwm/">[comments]</a></span>
