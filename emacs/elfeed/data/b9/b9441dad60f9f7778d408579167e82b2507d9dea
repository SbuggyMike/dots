  Mastodon has announced a plan to <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/05/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon/">make the service easier to join</a>.
<p>
On the practical level, attention to these issues can make Mastodon
easier to use, and that is good.  In practical terms, this work is
worth doing.
<p>
On the level of values, the reference to Mastodon as a "product" made
me worry for Mastodon's future.  The values associated with making a
"product", and all the other words typically used by businesses, are
corrupting.  They infuse a set of goals that are incompatible with
respecting people.
