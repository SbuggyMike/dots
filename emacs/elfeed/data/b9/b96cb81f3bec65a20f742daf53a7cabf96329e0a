The Democrats' great "deal" with Manchin includes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/28/climate-bill-joe-manchin-whats-in-it">increased drilling
for fossil fuels</a>.
<p>
It is one step forward in exchange for Manchin's <a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/two-cheers-for-manchin-and-the-dems">demanded half a step
back</a>.
<p>
The deal also includes some positive changes regarding taxes: a 15%
corporate profits minimum tax, more higher tax on private equity funds,
and funding the IRS to investigate tax cheaters that aren't poor.
<p>
Also, it makes an effort to reduce the cost of medicines for people
on Medicare.  Sanders called it <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/07/26/it-better-nothing-i-suppose-sanders-disappointed-dems-drug-pricing-plan">"better than nothing."</a>
<p>
Overall, it is a change for the better, but the additional wells
will pump <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-jan-apr.html#5_April_2022_(Global_heating_distraction_guarantees_disaster)">death for decades</a>.
<p>
But we must never talk about this deal without condemning the price
to civilization that Manchin has charged for it.
