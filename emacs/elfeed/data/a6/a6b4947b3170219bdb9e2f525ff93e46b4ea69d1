<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I started using helm and I like it and can already feel its power. But there are two difficulties I am not getting solved.</p> <p>1) Is it possible to turn off the display of the full path and just show the base filename in Recentf and Files-from-the-current-directory in my helm-mini-buffer? I know it is done in helm-find-files, but I cannot find a way to turn off the path when using the former two.</p> <p>2) Helm-recentf and helm-find-files use icons, which I like, because it helps me find the right file quick and at a glance. Files-from-the-current-directory doesn&#39;t show the icons. I would love to have it consistent, as I have both in a helm-mini-buffer, Recentf and Current-directory. Do you know a way to achieve this?</p> <p>Thank you so much for any advice!</p> <p>Best regards</p> <p>Titus</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TiMueller"> /u/TiMueller </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whntfp/helm_turn_off_full_path_in_recentf_and_show_icons/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whntfp/helm_turn_off_full_path_in_recentf_and_show_icons/">[comments]</a></span>
