<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to archlinux. I&#39;m using pipewire. I can can connect to my bluetooth headphones no problem. However, when I connect the sound is extremely low quality. I did some research, I think I need to switch my sound profile from Headset Head Unit (HSP/HFP) to A2DP but that option isn&#39;t available. It was working fine yesterday but somehow broken after reboot. How do I troubleshoot?</p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/t0i0DJs">Image Link</a> </p> <p>Edit: Partially solved. My headphones has support for multiple devices. This issue only happens when I connect to my pc as a secondary device. When I removed my other devices I was able to select A2DP and the sound quality was normal. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/a_ea"> /u/a_ea </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wa3lhs/extremely_low_quality_sound_from_bluetooth/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wa3lhs/extremely_low_quality_sound_from_bluetooth/">[comments]</a></span>
