<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello enthusiasts! I do not know if this is the right community, but can I ask for your broad knowledge on classical musics for a suggesion on a classical music that starts in a positive mood like joyful or energetic then ends in a tragedic or sad mood. But the tricky part is it should be short, probably 1-4 minutes in length. Please help me, thank you very much in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Significant-Row8316"> /u/Significant-Row8316 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wfia61/classical_music_suggestions_urgent/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wfia61/classical_music_suggestions_urgent/">[comments]</a></span>
