Contrary to what many say, running into the US debt ceiling will not
make the US default on its debts.  Rather, it will stop the US from
doing the normal daily borrowing that is necessary
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/debt-ceiling-economic-calamity-gop">to make daily
payments</a>
that the government has to make.
<p>
Social security payments, like purchases, are rather payments that the
US will have an obligation to make, but they are not for debts because
they are not repayment of loans.
<p>
Failing to pay them could be considered a default in some sense,
but it would not be defaulting <em>on debt</em>.

What the 14th amendment says about this, I don't know.
