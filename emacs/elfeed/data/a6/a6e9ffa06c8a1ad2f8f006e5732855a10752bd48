<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done quite a bit of research but still not sure where to start. For background, i&#39;m a 10+ years software dev working on web frontends, occastional CMS and bespoke API backend. I currently use VSCode on linux but want to improve the efficiency of my overall workflow and emacs really seems to focus on that. Setup is QWERTY laptop keyboard or docked with normal QWERTY keyboard so no ergo/custom keyboard setup.</p> <p>I am able to dedicated 2hrs a day to this within my work but am not sure where to start....</p> <p>I have used Vim briefly in the past and didn&#39;t mind the modal editing mode, tried the emacs vanilla for about an hour and can tell pretty quickly that the stretch for ctrl is annoying and awkward.</p> <p>Question:</p> <p>- Where do I start? Do I keep doing vanilla emacs and remap CTRL to caps or space? or just go evil mode? and if evil mode then do I just do Doom emacs or just setup each plugin manually to learn each plugin better? or do I go more left field and try boon or meow?</p> <p>I&#39;m happy to work on emacs for a while on the side while I get it setup and learn enough to be productive before switching from vscode.</p> <p>And yes, I plan to expand my emacs use beyond code editing, to include tooling around development (git, gitlab/hub, JIRA etc) and comms (slack, gmail, outlook etc) and documentation (currently notion or md files)</p> <p>Any guidance would be much appreciated and apologies if there is a link or question like this that is already answered.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/scycer"> /u/scycer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w0uapz/beginner_guidance/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w0uapz/beginner_guidance/">[comments]</a></span>
