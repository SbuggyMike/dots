<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This sounds like a easy question but it has been a long time and I can&#39;t figure out the <em>why</em>.<br/> In any Linux I&#39;ve tried, closing the lid and reopening it makes it a black screen, no input, devices disabled, and the processor fan goes to the <strong>MAX.</strong> Not kidding. It gets LOUD. In normal operation this barely ever happens if at all.<br/> I&#39;ve done my research. It seems to be a problem with Bay Trail Processors (which my <strong>Pentium N3450</strong> is), relating to something called the &quot;CState&quot; of the processor (whatever that is). Setting <code>intel_idle.max_cstate=1</code> should&#39;ve done the trick.<br/> The thing is, it doesn&#39;t. My laptop doesn&#39;t do what I want. I have to always set closing the lid to do nothing on the power settings of whatever I&#39;m using.<br/> On Windows this doesn&#39;t ocurr at all, the system is able to suspend just fine. It seems to dislike Linux.<br/> Does someone have a 2nd opinion on what could I do? The Arch Wiki says &quot;just downgrade the kernel lmao&quot; but I have the feeling it won&#39;t work. </p> <p>Relevant neofetch:</p> <p>OS: Arch Linux x86_64 </p> <p>Host: 370E4J/370E4Q P05RDF </p> <p>Kernel: 5.18.14-arch1-1 </p> <p>Uptime: 8 mins</p> <p>Packages: 926 (pacman) </p> <p>Shell: bash 5.1.16 </p> <p>Resolution: 1366x768 </p> <p>DE: GNOME 42.3.1 </p> <p>WM: Mutter </p> <p>WM Theme: Adwaita </p> <p>Theme: Adwaita [GTK2/3] </p> <p>Icons: Adwaita [GTK2/3] </p> <p>Terminal: gnome-terminal </p> <p>CPU: Intel Pentium N3540 (4) @ 2.665GHz </p> <p>GPU: Intel Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Graphics &amp; Display </p> <p>Memory: 1399MiB / 3808MiB</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Polytelus"> /u/Polytelus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w90af1/i_cant_suspend_my_laptop_whats_wrong/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w90af1/i_cant_suspend_my_laptop_whats_wrong/">[comments]</a></span>
