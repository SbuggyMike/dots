<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I usually use Lutris as a Flatpak, So that if I decided to uninstall it for some reason, I wouldn&#39;t have to manually uninstall ~100 libs and It would be easy for me to reinstall it in case I broke something.</p> <p>Now, I&#39;ve heard many people here and there, saying that the Flatpak version of Lutris is quite bad and some games might have trouble running.</p> <p>Is it better to switch to the native version then?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/1_7xr"> /u/1_7xr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyidcq/lutris_as_native_pacman_package_or_flatpak/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vyidcq/lutris_as_native_pacman_package_or_flatpak/">[comments]</a></span>
