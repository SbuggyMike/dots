<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>All, I&#39;m possibly overthinking this so I&#39;m bracing for downvotes.</p> <p>Briefly -- I&#39;m pivoting back into IT after a 15 year absence. Primarily a macOS user (since early 90s). But back in the day I enjoyed failing at spinning up LAMP servers, figuring out what I did wrong and then getting them to work. Same with SQL and other light admin stuff. I&#39;m currently back in IT in an official capacity and getting my sea legs back (Windows).</p> <p>Mid term plan is to get certs and start looking into junior admin stuff that could possibly lead to &lt;fill in blank&gt;. I&#39;ve taken a few passes at Python as well and it sits right in my fun zone so would enjoy adding that to my repertoire.</p> <p>I&#39;m leaning toward REHL, so am I overthinking this for choosing a daily driver distro to start ramping up my linux skills? Considering Rocky, Alma or Fedora but I&#39;m wondering if it even matters while I have my training wheels on.</p> <p>Am I overthinking this? Should I just grab a distro, load onto my Macbook Pro and give it a whack? I have an additional (older) MBP and a current Dell Latitude i7 if I want to get frisky and try Arch or change midstream.</p> <p>In the end I&#39;m not sweating this too much because even if this leads to no career change I love tinkering and growing tired of the Win/Mac plantations. Thanks for any input.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/swartzfeger"> /u/swartzfeger </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wfh6ib/rhel_fedora_rocky_alma_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wfh6ib/rhel_fedora_rocky_alma_or/">[comments]</a></span>
