The Tories want to ban communication systems that use end-to-end
encryption.  They've announced their decision that "safety", supposedly
to be achieved by monitoring everyone's communications, outweighs privacy,
so digital systems that maintai8n our privacy against state surveillance
will be banned.

The WhatsApp application is nonfree software -- users can't tell what
it really does, let alone fix anything malicious or merely broken that
may be in it.  So many nonfree programs are malware that we shouldn't
suppose any of them is honest.  The nonfree WhatsApp App could send
all the user's private nessages, in plain text form, to whoever
Meta/Facebook wishes, whether that be the Chinese government, the UK
government, the US government, or Meta itself.

We can't have free software packages that do communication with
end-to-end encryption if communication systens with end-to-end
encryption are prohibited.  Paradoxically, a proporietary app which is
not fit to trust may protect our right to have systems which can be
worthy of our trust.
