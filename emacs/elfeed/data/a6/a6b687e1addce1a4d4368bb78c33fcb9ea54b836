Texas "educators", fearing the law restricting schools from teaching
about racism, proposed to rename 
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/07/01/texas-panel-denounced-over-attempt-rebrand-slavery-involuntary-relocation">slavery as "involuntary relocation".</a>
<p>
That reminds me of 
<a href="https://stallman.org/antiglossary.html#detained">"detained".</a>
<p>
and 
<a href="https://stallman.org/antiglossary.html#rendition">"rendition"</a>
two other terms designed to hide the reality of what they refer to.

If properly taught, comparing voluntary immigration with the transport
of slaves could teach students a lot about what slavery was.  But
teaching that properly would be illegal in Texas -- so they must have
been planning to downplay the truth.

Historically, slavery <Em>in British colonies</Em> was achieved by forced
transportation of Africans.  But that was not true everywhere else.
Slavery in Spanish colonies started with the indigenous people Spain
had conquered.  It did not involve transporting them, since they were
worked as slaves in the land where they lived.  That didn't make it
less horrible.

Millennia earlier, the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt also
occurred in the place where they already lived.
