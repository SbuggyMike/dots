<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Emacs community! Recently I decided to learn Swift, and for my pet project I chose writing an easy-to-use API for Emacs dynamic modules.<br/> Here is it: <a href="https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module">https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module</a><br/> My main motivation (except for learning, of course) was writing some UI extensions for Emacs using this approach. This is something I&#39;ll play with next.<br/> If I got you interested and you want to help with it, or simply give it a try, please do! And don&#39;t hesitate to reach out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vsavchenko"> /u/vsavchenko </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wemj1z/writing_emacs_dynamic_modules_in_swift/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wemj1z/writing_emacs_dynamic_modules_in_swift/">[comments]</a></span>
