<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/tigerswan">A spy company</a>
hired by the companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline
used lawful and unlawful methods to snoop on the campaigners opposing
to the pipeline.

For me, the most important thing about the pipeline is that it would
lead to more fossil fuel use for a long time, and therefore contribute
to global disaster.  It is interesting that, for the author of the
article, the fact that indigenous people lived nearby and played a
major role in that campaign is more important than helping to save the world.
