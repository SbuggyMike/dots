<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wrote a package that uses <code>ryo-modal</code> in order to provide colon commands like in vim and kakoune. However, unlike other colon commands I have seen in Emacs, it is also compatible with interactive completion and marginalia. <a href="https://gitlab.com/mohsmth1/ryo-colon-commands/-/raw/main/screenshot.jpeg">screenshot</a>. So far there are only basic commands I put in as a POC, but I would like to reimplement more of kakoune&#39;s functionality.</p> <p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mohsmth1/ryo-colon-commands">link</a></p> <p>I also have a repo for ryo leader keys that are similar to doom emacs, and my modified kakoune.el.</p> <p>I only have written lisp for a brief time, so these packages could probably be improved on.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Any-Pollution7845"> /u/Any-Pollution7845 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whkwr3/ryo_colon_commands_and_some_other_packages_i_wrote/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/whkwr3/ryo_colon_commands_and_some_other_packages_i_wrote/">[comments]</a></span>
