Portugal requires residents to have a biometric ID card for many
purposes, including medical care, employment and travel.  This is an
injustice to everyone that is compelled to have the card; it is also a 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/06/britons-portugal-post-brexit-id-cards">practical disaster for the resident foreigners who can't get one.</a>

The government seems to be using those foreigners as hostages to an
international dispute, but we should not let this distract us from
the injustice those cards present to people who DO have them.
