<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you ever installed Devuan using the &quot;desktop-live&quot; installation iso and checked the option to disable the root account, chances are you might have gotten a system with a root account with a blank password instead.</p> <p>At least that&#39;s what the Devuan Chimaera installer seems to be doing as of 2023:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/nicolascolla/WTF-Devuan">https://github.com/nicolascolla/WTF-Devuan</a></p> <p>I would love to report this bug but, after trying three times to use the &quot;reportbug&quot; utility with three different emails, and never getting a confirmation email or <a href="https://bugs.devuan.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?package=refractainstaller-gui">my bug report appearing anywhere</a> after nine hours, I gave up, since the tool seems to be failing silently (which means I don&#39;t really know how to send a bug report). And since public disclosure of this possible bug does zero harm (I don&#39;t see any way in which the devs could retroactively fix this, rolling an update to silently change <em>your root password</em> is not something that&#39;d work, probably) I post it here so that everyone can check their own system, and, hopefully, some Devuan dev can see it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nicolascolla"> /u/nicolascolla </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/130ubca/psa_if_you_use_devuan_check_your_root_password/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/130ubca/psa_if_you_use_devuan_check_your_root_password/">[comments]</a></span>
