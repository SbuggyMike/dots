<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m playing a 24hr daily game and this dude blundered a lot of pieces. It&#39;s now down to my king and queen and his queen. Basic mating pattern.</p> <p>Well he&#39;s trying to be rather annoying since he lost all his pieces he went from a few hours or less per move to pretty much 24 hours once his king was alone. I imagine he&#39;s waiting as long as possible in the off chance I forget about the game and draw.</p> <p>So I went into the &quot;conditional moves&quot; and figured out all of the moves he can make with his king before I can mate him since he was stuck on the h file.</p> <p>I put in all the moves and forgot about the game for 3 days until I got the checkmate notification. So satisfying. A chess moment I&#39;ve never had as I went from exclusively playing blitz to setting up a bunch of daily games to study opening theory. </p> <p>Anyways, I have no friends that like chess so I had no one to share my excitement with lmao thanks if you read my dumb ass post</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChairmanUzamaoki"> /u/ChairmanUzamaoki </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132ody8/most_satisfying_notification_ive_ever_received/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132ody8/most_satisfying_notification_ive_ever_received/">[comments]</a></span>
