<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Growing up I knew about Ntini, and that according to my Dad he was a pretty good bowler, &quot;but not as good as some others&quot;. I didn&#39;t really know a whole lot about him, or many cricketers to be fair - I was a young kid.</p> <p>A few minutes ago I randomly got the thought to look up Ntini&#39;s stats. The fact that he got close to 400 Test wickets, but was not somebody that got mentioned a whole lot when discussing the great pace bowlers has been a thought at the back of my mind for a while. So I decided to have a look at his numbers.</p> <p>The first thing I noticed was that he had a &#39;terrible&#39; year in 2001. As a South African pace bowler, he only took 19 wickets in 11 Tests (at 47) in 2001. That&#39;s not something you see all that often from opening or first change Test bowlers - when you do it&#39;s usually a bowler&#39;s worst year, or somebody that only played a handful of Tests. But then I thought... &quot;Hold up, if he took close to 400 wickets in around 100 Tests while also having a year as bad as that, then he&#39;s probably had some great years to make up the other 370~..&quot;.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>And that he did:</strong></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align="left">Years</th> <th align="left">Tests</th> <th align="left">Wickets</th> <th align="left">Average</th> <th align="left">Strike rate</th> <th align="left">Five fors</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align="left">1998 - 2002</td> <td align="left">21</td> <td align="left">46</td> <td align="left">37</td> <td align="left">77</td> <td align="left">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">2002 - 2007</td> <td align="left">54</td> <td align="left">262</td> <td align="left">25</td> <td align="left">46</td> <td align="left">16</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">2007 - 2009</td> <td align="left">26</td> <td align="left">82</td> <td align="left">33</td> <td align="left">61</td> <td align="left">1</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Just look at those middle five years (It&#39;s 5 years and 7 months); other than his average, those are some straight up Alan Donald numbers.</p> <p>He was the highest wicket taker for pace bowlers during that time period; and taking just shy of five a match. To take that many wickets, at that strike rate over 54 Tests is pretty incredible.</p> <p>Where do you think he ranks among great pace bowlers, and how do <em>you</em> think about and compare him to others?</p> <p>He finished his career with an average just shy of 29, and his strike rate is good; but not exceptional. I haven&#39;t looked into it very far, but if I had to guess, I would assume that his peak relative to his overall career is better than &quot;average&quot; for players who took over 200 Test wickets. By that I mean, if two bowlers both took 250 wickets in 80 Tests at 30, with one of them having a peak where they took 150 wickets in 40 Tests at 28, and the other, 150 wickets in 30 Tests at 23, then the second player&#39;s peak relative to their career is greater than the first player&#39;s. Conversely, their other 100 wickets would come at an average of 33, and 40 respectively.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MonkSalad1"> /u/MonkSalad1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w4f2cw/i_had_no_idea_ntinis_peak_was_this_good_career_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w4f2cw/i_had_no_idea_ntinis_peak_was_this_good_career_in/">[comments]</a></span>
