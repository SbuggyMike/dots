<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I have the exact same problem as described in this post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/2y0o8f/systemctl_suspend_fails/">https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/2y0o8f/systemctl_suspend_fails/</a> but I haven&#39;t been able to find a solution.</p> <p>In my desktop computer, running systemctl suspend will shut off the screen and leds for a split second, then the leds light up and fans start spinning but there is no screen output. And now it&#39;s stuck in this state unless you hard reset.</p> <p>Also, I can&#39;t hibernate the computer.</p> <p>Any ideas what might be happening? This didn&#39;t happen before.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Fish9557"> /u/No-Fish9557 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8sajz/systemctl_suspend_not_working_at_all/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8sajz/systemctl_suspend_not_working_at_all/">[comments]</a></span>
