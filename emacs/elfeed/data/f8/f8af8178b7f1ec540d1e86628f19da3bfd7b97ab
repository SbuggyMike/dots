<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Mine would be, without a doubt, Beethoven and Scriabin. Beethoven because he was so ahead of his time and had already begun to predict jazz/ragtime in his 32nd sonata, so seeing what more he could do with 20 years (3 more symphonies maybe?!) would have been out of this world. And Scriabin because, well, MYSTERIUM. Runner up would be Bach, art of the fugue.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pot4toM4n07"> /u/Pot4toM4n07 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wf4kge/question_if_you_could_choose_two_composers_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wf4kge/question_if_you_could_choose_two_composers_in/">[comments]</a></span>
