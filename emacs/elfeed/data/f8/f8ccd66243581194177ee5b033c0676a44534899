Alonso- known for his machiavellian mastery- promply blindsided his current team and agreed a move to Aston Martin, kicking off a firestorm.</p> <p>So far, so formula 1. But team boss at Alpine, Otmar Szafnauer, cited Alonso’s age as justification for refusing to grant him an extended contract. In the course of this, he made the following comparison with cricket:</p> <p>“And it happens to other sportsmen – cricketers, with all due respect to all of you that play cricket, it’s not such a physically strenuous sport. It’s all about eye-hand coordination, moving the bat to the right millimetres.”</p> <p>My rebuttal to Otmar would be that cricket is much like F1 in reaction times- try facing a Jofra Archer 96mph bouncer.</p> <p>Fast bowling is also pretty strenuous, there’s a reason Anderson is the oldest pace bowler in Test matches for about 40 years.</p> <p>Discuss</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jwhits373"> /u/jwhits373 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://the-race.com/formula-1/alpines-logic-for-not-offering-alonso-what-he-wanted/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wg2bwx/formula_1_team_boss_says_cricket_not_a_physically/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
