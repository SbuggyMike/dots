<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Whilst I get Wayland <em>is</em> the future I have a bunch of issues with it. Off the top of my head…</p> <p>1) 60FPS recording is broken on OBS. Looks like 30FPS (GNOME). 2) OBS hotkeys don’t work. 3) Retroarch doesn’t have window decorations. The FlatPak &amp; SNAP versions have a hack that replaces them, but they both have their own issues (no udev and the SNAP is just broken). 4) Retroarch can’t use a dGPU (AMD at least) on Vulkan. It just ends up garbled. 5) GNOME is about the only DE that is stable on Wayland. KDE is still somewhat buggy and most other main DEs are still X11-only. 5) Lack of native Wayland support in apps generally. Quite a few won’t launch without environment variables or at all.</p> <p>No hate on Wayland, but pleading for people to stop using it is an uphill battle…</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CaliDreamin1991"> /u/CaliDreamin1991 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13hn54f/the_whole_x11_vs_wayland_thing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/13hn54f/the_whole_x11_vs_wayland_thing/">[comments]</a></span>
