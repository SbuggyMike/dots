<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This afternoon, Edgbaston hosted the first ever cricket match to be played at the Commonwealth Games, with 15 more fixtures scheduled throughout the remainder of the games. Over the past few days, there have also been two highly entertaining t20 games between England and South Africa, immediately proceed by three women&#39;s t20 games between the two nations. This is before factoring in a test series between England and South Africa, the one day cup, the conclusion to the county championship season, plus a variety of other international and domestic cricket fixtures scattered across the next couple of months.</p> <p>Taking all of this into account, who is actually looking forward to the Hundred? With so much other quality cricket on offer, it staggers me that anyone would waste their time with that complete dross.</p> <p>While it&#39;s really not my cup of tea, I&#39;m genuinely keen to know if the majority feels the same way, or whether I&#39;m just morphing into grandpa Simpson, quietly shaking his fist at the sky.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DrOliverReeder"> /u/DrOliverReeder </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wbi4nq/is_anyone_actually_looking_forward_to_the_hundred/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wbi4nq/is_anyone_actually_looking_forward_to_the_hundred/">[comments]</a></span>
