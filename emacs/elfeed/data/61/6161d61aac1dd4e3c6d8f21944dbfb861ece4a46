The city of Long Beach was founded by the people who founded the church. The building was built in 1914 and the proceeds from the $50 tickets will go to building preservation and restoration. I donâ€™t know when will be the next time anyone will get a chance to see a flute player this famous in a small venue like this for only $50 per ticket. If you love classical flute and you live near Long Beach, California you should hop on this. <a href="https://bit.ly/FluteConcertRD">https://bit.ly/FluteConcertRD</a> </p> <p><a href="https://reddit.com/link/was1ua/video/1jmg8zy0yee91/player">https://reddit.com/link/was1ua/video/1jmg8zy0yee91/player</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdreanaInLB"> /u/AdreanaInLB </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/was1ua/flute_soloist_jeane_ferrandis_will_play_bach/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/was1ua/flute_soloist_jeane_ferrandis_will_play_bach/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
