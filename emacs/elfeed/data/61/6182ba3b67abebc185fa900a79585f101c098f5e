<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m adding them to my map, <a href="https://www.classicalconcertmap.com/">classicalconcertmap.com</a>. So far, I have only added Ravinia, Tanglewood, Bowdoin, and Spoleto, though I have a lot more on my list . . . but it&#39;s not quite as easy to find these as it is to find orchestras, which means it&#39;s all the more important to get them onto my map, so please, if you have a favorite, let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thythr"> /u/thythr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/132943i/what_are_your_favorite_summer_classical_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/132943i/what_are_your_favorite_summer_classical_music/">[comments]</a></span>
