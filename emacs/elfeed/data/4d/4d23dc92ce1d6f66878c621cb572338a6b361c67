The editorial board of the journal Neuroimage
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/07/too-greedy-mass-walkout-at-global-science-journal-over-unethical-fees">resigned as a body
in protest</a>
of how much Elsevier charges to publish a paper.
<p>
There should be a standard charge to the authors for publishing a paper,
which research grants should cover; for authors that don't have such grants,
the journal should waive the charge.
