<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yeah, ik that I need to play humans to have a real game. But I hv been stuck with fide 1900 for a very long time and am not able to push it above 2000.</p> <p>Tbh my endgame sucks balls. I can even win a piece with a 2000 in early game but until the end I happen to lose. Whenever I try to play humans to improve endgame, everyone tends to resign. Its a stupid question ik but if there is any suggestion please tell.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hey_son_its_dad"> /u/hey_son_its_dad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wd6v5q/is_there_any_humanlike_computer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wd6v5q/is_there_any_humanlike_computer/">[comments]</a></span>
