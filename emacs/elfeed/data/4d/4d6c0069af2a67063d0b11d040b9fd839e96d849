Amazon regularly gives Ring door camera videos to the government without
getting 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/13/amazon-ring-doorbell-videos-police-11-times-without-permission">permission from the camera's nominal owner.</a>
<p>
This is a secondary wrong which makes those cameras a little more
unjust.  But they would be plenty unjust without this.  When millions
of people make videos of everyone that walks past their door, and hand
the recordings over to a particular company to store, that's asking
for abuse of the recordings.

prohibited.</a>
<p>
Basically, you should be required to set up the camera so that it only
sees people when they approach your door, not when they pass by on the
sidewalk.
