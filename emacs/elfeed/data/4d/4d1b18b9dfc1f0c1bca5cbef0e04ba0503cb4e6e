<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m struggling a bit with the key binds system in Emacs. I&#39;m aware, that my setup is probably pretty unique, but I hope someone might have at least some answers for me:</p> <p>Because I&#39;m not using a standard QWERTY layout but instead a Dvorak layout, I have to rebind most of the normal binds. I&#39;m doing this with evil-mode and a custom minor mode, through which I declare all navigation keys. This <code>evil-dvorak-mode</code> is turned on globally. The basic motion keys for me look like this:</p> <pre><code>(evil-define-key &#39;visual evil-dvorak-mode-map &quot;h&quot; &#39;evil-next-line &quot;t&quot; &#39;evil-previous-line &quot;d&quot; &#39;evil-backward-char &quot;n&quot; &#39;evil-forward-char ) </code></pre> <p>I&#39;m also redefining most commands through a system of leader keys with the package <code>evil-leader</code>, which is also turned on globally. For example:</p> <pre><code>(evil-leader/set-leader &quot;SPC&quot;) (evil-leader/set-key &quot;bs&quot; &#39;save-buffer &quot;bb&quot; &#39;consult-buffer ) </code></pre> <p>Both of these systems work under normal conditions reliably, but they tend to break under any special circumstances, and I have no idea how to guarantee all key binds are working as intended. </p> <p>Some of the issues I have encountered:</p> <p>- Certain buffers can override the navigation keys, especially the org-mode *Agenda* buffer. Even if I specifically bind <code>org-agenda-next-line</code> for the <code>org-agenda-mode-map</code> nothing seems to happen. </p> <p>- For certain mini-buffers and selections, I want to define <code>C-h</code> and <code>C-t</code> for motion. I&#39;m doing this by simply calling <code>define-key</code> for the specific map. This approach has worked for both <code>Selectrum</code> and <code>Company</code>, but when I was trying out <code>Corfu</code> today, pressing the keys simply triggered their normal Emacs behavior. </p> <p>- In the standard *Messages* buffer the navigation keys are working without problems, but the leader keys aren&#39;t available, the same happens in the org-mode Agenda. Currently, the space bar is my main leader key, and it appears in these modes that key gets overwritten somehow.</p> <p>If anybody has a setup even remotely similar to mine, some input would be appreciated. I would especially like to know how I can define key bindings without having them overwritten by some other mode or package. For more context, my entire key binds setup can be found <a href="https://github.com/jakobklemm/dots/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/modules/input.el">here</a>.</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JeykeyLP"> /u/JeykeyLP </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wjh7pd/how_to_actually_define_key_binds_in_emacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wjh7pd/how_to_actually_define_key_binds_in_emacs/">[comments]</a></span>
