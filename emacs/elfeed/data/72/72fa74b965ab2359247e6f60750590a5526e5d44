You have a TypeScript project, organized in a monorepo because there is some common code you want to share between, say, your backend and frontend. Let's say it looks like this:
- backend/index.ts - backend/utils.ts &lt;- you want to share this with frontend - frontend/index.ts Unfortunately it's not as easy as throwing the common TypeScript code into a folder.
You have to treat the common code as if you're making a helper library, which also means building the TypeScript yourself.
