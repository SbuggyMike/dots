<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, I wanted to install Arch on my old laptop.. I used the live USB to configure first WiFi and then archinstall, it finished and asked to switch to chroot or something like that and I selected no and then rebooted, it booted me back into the live USB and even when going into bios it does not show my arch drive.. I think the problem is I have legacy bios and i think archinstall only supports uefi.. I&#39;m not sure what to do next.. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/himicz"> /u/himicz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3phak/fresh_install_of_arch_not_showing_up_in_bios/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3phak/fresh_install_of_arch_not_showing_up_in_bios/">[comments]</a></span>
