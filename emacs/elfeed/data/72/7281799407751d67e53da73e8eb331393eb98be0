E Jean Carroll won her lawsuit against <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#bullshitter">the bullshitter</a>, who was
ordered to pay damages for grabbing her and trying to rape her, and
later
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/09/e-jean-carroll-wins-trump-trial-verdict">calling her a liar for saying he did that</a>.
<p>
The result demonstrates that <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#bullshitter">the bullshitter</a> cannot always get away
with
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/10/e-jean-carroll-lawsuit-trump-sexual-abuser">"grabbing them</a>
by the pussy."
<p>
This defeat is not sufficient &mdash; he is
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-jan-apr.html#23_April_2022_(Running_out_of_time_to_prosecute_the_wrecker)">still getting away with</a>
a far bigger and more egregious crime: leading a failed plot to overthrow the US government.
