<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;ve been a long time user of Ivy and Counsel but a couple of days ago I decided to give Vertico, Embark and Consult a try. I&#39;m very joyful with them so far, however I&#39;m having a couple of issues: - 1. I&#39;ve read that using Embark to collect a list of grep results should result in a <code>grep-mode</code> buffer. I used to use Ivy to produce an <code>occur</code> buffer which I could then edit allowing me to make changes across multiple files easily. Getting a <code>grep-mode</code> buffer sounded good to me as I could then use <code>wgrep</code> to edit these‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­matches directly in a similar way. However, when I collect these results (via <code>embark-collect-live</code>, <code>embark-collect-snapshot</code> or <code>embark-export</code>) I always end up with an <code>embark-collect-mode</code> buffer. I cannot see a way from here to make this a <code>grep-mode</code> buffer or to make changes to these matches in the same way I would in an editable <code>occur</code> buffer. 2. In the collected results as mentioned in the first question, if I press <code>RET</code> on any of these results I get the following error: <code>Error running timer ‘consult--async-after-change’: (buffer-read-only #&lt;buffer *Embark Collect*&gt;)</code>. I&#39;m currently using Emacs 28.0.50 and I use Evil mode. Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The9thHuman"> /u/The9thHuman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wgnau9/question_about_editing_consultembark_ripgrep/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wgnau9/question_about_editing_consultembark_ripgrep/">[comments]</a></span>
