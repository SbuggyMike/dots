<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been trying to run arch(linux-lts) with ZFS on root by following the guide on the wiki and cannot get passed this error message:</p> <blockquote> <p>Starting version 251.3-1-arch</p> <p>ERROR: device &#39;zfs:rpool/arch&#39; not found Skipping fsck.</p> <p>mount: /new_root: unknown filesystem type &#39;nfs&#39;.</p> <p>dmesg(1) may have more infomation after failed mount system call.</p> <p>You are now being dropped into an emergency shell.</p> <p>sh: can&#39;t access tty: job control turned off</p> </blockquote> <p>dmesg doesn&#39;t seem to have anything glaringly wrong. And I have recheck the wiki pages to ensure I did everything.</p> <p>Any help would be deeply appreciated. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flippers2652"> /u/flippers2652 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whegsf/cant_boot_from_zfsarch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/whegsf/cant_boot_from_zfsarch/">[comments]</a></span>
