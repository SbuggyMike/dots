<p>&#8216;The claimant was a member of the defendant’s church. She and her husband had formed a close friendship with an elder in the church. During a visit to the elder’s house in 1990, the elder raped the claimant while they were together in a room. She reported the crime to the police in 2014 and her assailant was convicted and imprisoned. She then brought a claim against the defendant alleging that it was vicariously liable for the elder’s attack on her. At first instance, the trial judge held that the defendant was vicariously liable and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court.&#8217;</p>
