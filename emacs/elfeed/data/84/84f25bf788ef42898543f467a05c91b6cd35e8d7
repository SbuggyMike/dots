<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To provide some context, I connected to my wifi using `iwctl` and then running `dhcpcd`. I now understand that `iwd` has a built in dhcp client, but oh well.</p> <p>In gnome, under settings &gt; wifi, it doesn&#39;t look like I&#39;m connected. I try to connect there, and it isn&#39;t able to correctly authenticate. I&#39;d prefer it if I connected through the GUI rather than the console.</p> <p>So I&#39;m trying to understand what the relationships are between all these programs. I&#39;ve a feeling that they sort of interfere with each other?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DGReddAuthor"> /u/DGReddAuthor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131uy14/whats_the_relationship_between_iwd_network/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/131uy14/whats_the_relationship_between_iwd_network/">[comments]</a></span>
