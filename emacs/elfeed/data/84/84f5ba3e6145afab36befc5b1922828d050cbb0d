<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi everybody,</p> <p>I use a file as my main &quot;dashboard&quot; and I would like to insert an agenda view into it. The idea is to &quot;refresh&quot; this buffer, remove the currently displayed agenda, compute the agenda for the day, and insert it into this buffer.</p> <p>I can do lisp, but I wonder if there is something similar to what I am trying to do that might have been already implemented.</p> <p>I guess ultimately I can look at the source code of org-agenda and reuse its code, but I am wondering if I would be &quot;rediscovering the wheel&quot;</p> <p>thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dm_g"> /u/dm_g </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w30m1r/problematically_generate_the_agenda_view_so_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w30m1r/problematically_generate_the_agenda_view_so_it/">[comments]</a></span>
