<p>A quickie with some good news. Álvaro Ramírez’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command">dwim-shell-command</a> is now <a href="https://xenodium.com/dwim-shell-command-on-melpa/">available for download from Melpa</a>. I’ve written several posts on this package [<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10653">1</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10660">2</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10674">3</a>] and really like what Ramírez is doing with it so I’m glad to see it’s now easily installable.</p>
<p>Ramírez’s post says that the package should soon be on Melpa and when I checked, it was already there. Ramírez has links to his previous posts on his announcement so if you aren’t already familiar with it, you should take a look. His posts give you a good idea of what it can do. If you’re like me and want to make Emacs the nexus of your computer activities, this package is a boon.</p>
