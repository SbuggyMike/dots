<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am running emacs-29. I have <code>pixel-scroll-precision-mode</code> enabled and <code>fast-but-imprecise-scrolling</code> set to <code>t</code>. For some reason, when I scroll with my mousepad slowly, if I try to scroll past the current line number, it will jump back to the original position that the screen was in. i am wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar issue and if there is any way to fix this. This seems to only happen in evil non-insert states. Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Far-Anywhere2876"> /u/Far-Anywhere2876 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132gmsp/cursor_seems_to_get_stuck_when_scrolling_need/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/132gmsp/cursor_seems_to_get_stuck_when_scrolling_need/">[comments]</a></span>
