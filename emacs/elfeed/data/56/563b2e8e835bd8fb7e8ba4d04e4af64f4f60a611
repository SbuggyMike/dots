<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>for a few days, I notice that many applications start extremely slowly. they are not all applications. I believe qtapplications are not affected. only GTK. noticed it with especially in the following programs: firefox, thunar, evolution, GNOME systemmonitor, libreoffice. Not affected are: vlc, octopi, terminology.</p> <p>if I start the application in terminal, no error message will appear. it takes about 20 to 30 seconds until the program appears on the screen. cruel!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thunderace77"> /u/Thunderace77 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13jbw2q/applications_starts_very_very_slow/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13jbw2q/applications_starts_very_very_slow/">[comments]</a></span>
