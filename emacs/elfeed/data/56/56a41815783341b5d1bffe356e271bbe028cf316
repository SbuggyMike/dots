<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been trying to get Xorg going as a systemd service. So far the most success I&#39;ve had is with this <a href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2021-startx-systemd">guide</a> outlining using it as a global (not user) service. I also happen to be using systemd-homed and the service fails since it launches before I have a chance to unlock my home directory. The service works perfectly fine once I&#39;ve logged in and start it using systemctl start ...</p> <p>Question is, which service should I be targeting in my After= and WantedBy= in my unit file.</p> <p>OTOH, if I run it as a --user service, and remove all the declarative extras, such as user User, WorkingDirectory, PAMName, TTYPath, ExecStartPre, and remove vt8 from the startx line or change it to vt1, the error I get is that it can&#39;t change the VT (permission denied).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sunesis311"> /u/sunesis311 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8bc63/letting_systemdhomed_settle/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8bc63/letting_systemdhomed_settle/">[comments]</a></span>
