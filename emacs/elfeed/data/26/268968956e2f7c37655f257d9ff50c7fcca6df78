Walgreens in Texas <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/07/11/post-roe-us-patients-already-denied-care-wide-range-medical-concerns">refused to prescribe methotrexate</a> for the purpose
of facilitating insertion of an IUD, claiming the pharmacy couldn't
know that it wasn't for an abortion.
<p>
Millions of people take methotrexate to treat various medical problems
other than pregnancy, and the Texas law has put them all in danger.
