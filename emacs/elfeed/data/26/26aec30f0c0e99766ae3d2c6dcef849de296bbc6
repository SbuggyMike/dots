  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/11/epa-plastic-based-fuel-cancer-risk-approval-questions">Suing the EPA for approving a plastic-recycling plant</a> that would cause a 1-in-4
risk of cancer for people who live nearby.

The risk of cancer will inevitably extend, though with decreasing
probability, to people who live somewhat farther away.  I wonder at
what distance that risk will decrease to an acceptable amount.
100 miles?  1000 miles east?

The report is vague, and represents estimates.  I can't be sure from this
report how much danger there would really be.  Perhaps Chevron can demonstrate
that the actual danger is far less.  But we should insist that it do so
by publishing measurements and analyses.
