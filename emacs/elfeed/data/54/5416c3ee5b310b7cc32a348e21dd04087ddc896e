<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use a product called MFiX for research which must be installed through anaconda. I know that package managers can cause a huge mess in the organization of your system, so I was doing some research on the arch forums to discern a &quot;best practice&quot; for installing conda. There seems to be two competing approaches to handling conda:</p> <p><strong>Approach 1 Don&#39;t do a system-wide install of conda:</strong> </p> <p>It defeats the purpose of anaconda and that is exactly how things get messy! To follow this approach I would just install anaconda following the directions from their website. This installs anaconda in my /home/charper/anaconda directory, so this is NOT system wide. Furthermore there is a step where the ask &quot;Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?‚Äù As long as I say no here, anaconda will not touch my dot files and I can just activate anaconda whenever I need by running source &lt;path to conda&gt;/bin/activate. This seems like a successful &quot;isolated&quot; install and will keep conda nicely quarantined from wreaking havoc on my system.</p> <p><strong>Approach 2 Don&#39;t follow their install, build from AUR:</strong> </p> <p>If you consistently build everything from AUR then pacman will keep track of everything for you. If you end up creating a mess and creating conflicts you can just uninstall anaconda and rebuild it from source whenever you need to run it. Building from AUR helps you stay consistent and keep everything in the same place. HOWEVER, installing through AUR by definition is a sytemwide install. This would put conda in my /usr/opt/bin and /usr/opt/lib...but one of the main pieces of advice I read when reading about installing anaconda is to NEVER do a system wide install. </p> <p>Is that not as much of a threat with arch linux because of how easy it is to just uninstall and rebuild different packages as you need them? Thus we are just easily creating whatever environment we need as we need it? Im a bit confused. This is my first arch install and I have already learned so much about how everything interacts and works, but it is a lot to take in. If I mess anything up , I feel confident I could do a clean reinstall and get back to here pretty quickly, however, I have sunk a lot of time into setting up this current build and would like to keep it clean and properly built. I appreciate any insights :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/charperflow"> /u/charperflow </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3pk9n/best_practices_for_installing_anaconda_on_arch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w3pk9n/best_practices_for_installing_anaconda_on_arch/">[comments]</a></span>
