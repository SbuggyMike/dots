<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying (again) to use org-mode for project management at work. If anything, this is more project management lite or task management at this point.</p> <p>Overall, my goals are to:</p> <ol> <li>Keep track of all the tasks I have to do in a given day. Some of these would be routine that I do every day, while others may be related to projects or action items from meetings.</li> <li>Be able to track the amount of time I spend working on each task and overall in a day. Right now I&#39;m using org&#39;s clocking function and this is working pretty well (most of the time).</li> <li>Be able to view any relations between projects. These may be dependencies or common items such as a particular framework or process.</li> <li>Ability to export the data for reporting purposes.</li> </ol> <p>To this end, so far I&#39;ve been using a combination of org-agenda (task management), org-roam (relations), and org-roam-ui (visual representation of relations). I know that org-agenda can be very slow when opening lots of files, so I&#39;ve done two things to mitigate that. I am using `vulpea` from <a href="https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-23-task-management-with-roam-vol1.html">Boris Buliga&#39;s series on task management with org-roam</a>, and creating files per preject and adding `IDs` to headers where appropriate.</p> <p>This seems to mostly work, until I completed all the tasks in my dailies file today and everything disappeared from my agenda (vulpea removes files from the `org-agenda-files` list when all tasks are complete), which showed me a rather large limitation of this system, imo.</p> <p>My other problem that I haven&#39;t figured out is, how do I export my clock history or project lists in a nice manner? I&#39;ve seen that `org-columns` is usually used for this, but it seems more intended for single large files, which I don&#39;t have at the moment.</p> <p>From my previous searching the last time I looked into this, and more searching over the last few days, it seems like this isn&#39;t a solved problem, and everyone has different solutions with different catches.</p> <p>That being said, I am conceptualizing (as I write this post) using a single large `tasks.org` file with all my project related tasks in it. This would contain headings that I add `IDs` to in order to link sections of projects together. I would then have my dailies files built from a template which has my standard day-to-day tasks in it that I would would complete and clock in/out of during the day. Then, I would build my `org-agenda` off of the large tasks file and X days of `dailies` files, depending on how far back I want to report on.</p> <p>I think my proposed solution may work, but it wouldn&#39;t help me much with reporting, and a lot of files would still be opened by `org-agenda` every time (8+ assuming I want to mainly do weekly views or less).</p> <p>Given my goals and proposed solution, what are your thoughts? Do you see anything that might trip me up or cause me issues down the road? I still feel like this is kind of a kludgy system, but I&#39;m also not sure of anything better at the moment...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Scary-Maple"> /u/Scary-Maple </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13801rg/question_about_project_management/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13801rg/question_about_project_management/">[comments]</a></span>
