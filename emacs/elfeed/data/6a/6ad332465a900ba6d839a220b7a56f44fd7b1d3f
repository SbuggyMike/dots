<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><code>project-find-file</code> in emacs seems to <em>sometimes</em> work for me, displaying a list of candidates, and right away. Sometimes, however, it doesn&#39;t. It might have something to do with the size of the repository, I haven&#39;t checked. For example, when I invoke <code>projectile-find-file</code> in the nixpkgs repository (which is huge), nothing is shown, and I cannot even enter a filename to open it. In my own, smaller repositories, it&#39;s working fine. I&#39;m using <code>ido-mode</code>, <code>ido-everywhere</code> and <code>ido-ubiquitous-mode</code> as well as <code>ido-vertical-mode</code>. Anyone else have this problem? It doesn&#39;t occur with projectile, just project.el. But I&#39;d like to stick to emacs built-in stuff.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pimiddy"> /u/pimiddy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w980qn/ido_and_projectfindfile_sometimes_dont_work/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w980qn/ido_and_projectfindfile_sometimes_dont_work/">[comments]</a></span>
