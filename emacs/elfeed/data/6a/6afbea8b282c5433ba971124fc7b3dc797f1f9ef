<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found myself down a cricket rabbit hole on Cricinfo and noticed Jack Leach has only ever played two T20 games. In the first, he bowled the second over, took a wicket in it and ended up with 3-28 off his 4 and Somerset won easily, the second game he this time bowled the first over, again took a wicket in that and ended up with 2-32 off his 4, again Somerset won easily. Overall he has 5 wickets @ 12 economy of 7.5 from his 2 matches. </p> <p>What’s the primary reason why he has he only played these two games? I know he’s not always available with England and had some really bad health but he played 6 years of first class cricket before selected and has also had spells out of the side in that time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Remarkable-Shine-63"> /u/Remarkable-Shine-63 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wgcxgw/why_doesnt_jack_leach_play_t20_cricket/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wgcxgw/why_doesnt_jack_leach_play_t20_cricket/">[comments]</a></span>
