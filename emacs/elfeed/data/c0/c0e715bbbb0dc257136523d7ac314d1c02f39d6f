<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using ivy and counsel for completion. When I M-x, I sometimes make small typos. For example:</p> <p>M-x descirbe function RET</p> <p>This of course returns no results, though the edit distance to the command &quot;describe-function&quot; is only 2.</p> <p>Is there any way to get graceful filtering to help filter out typos? basically something like vscode&#39;s filterGraceful.</p> <p>I&#39;m ok with switching from ivy to something else like helm as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Under-Estimated"> /u/Under-Estimated </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wi617l/graceful_matching_for_suggestions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wi617l/graceful_matching_for_suggestions/">[comments]</a></span>
