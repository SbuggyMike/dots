We shouldn't assume different
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/24/diane-abbott-letter">kinds of prejudice</a>
are equivalent,
or to try to set up a fixed order of how bad they are.
<p>
How harmful any given kind of prejudice is can vary from place to
place, and over time.
<p>
For example, antisemitism in the US was much worse before World War II
than it has been since the 1950s.  My mother told me a story about her
childhood in Brooklyn, about childen from of Catholic schools
screaming "Chris killer" while running after Jewish children &mdash; every
year after Easter.  The rest of the year they might be friendly.
