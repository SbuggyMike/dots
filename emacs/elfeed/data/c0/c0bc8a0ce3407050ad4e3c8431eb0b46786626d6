<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://sixtyfour.pro">Site link</a></p> <p>Planning for (eventually) 64 different games, with every 8 games part of a &quot;rank&quot; with a unique theme.</p> <p>First rank has the theme <em>&quot;Think&quot;</em> -- hopefully these will engage your mind and you&#39;ll figure out some patterns along the way. I tried to keep the level of difficulty to about medium for now.</p> <p><strong>Knight Swap</strong> - Swap the positions of the white and black knights on the miniboard. Easier version of Knightmare Swap.</p> <p><strong>King Walk</strong> - a fun puzzle if you&#39;ve never solved it before. I believe this may be the first interactive version of the puzzle.</p> <p><strong>Rook Slide</strong> - like the 15-16 game, with a slight twist.</p> <p><strong>Venom</strong> - become the piece you capture, it&#39;s like pinball meets chess.</p> <p><strong>Knight Tour</strong> - what I consider to be the Sudoku of chess, probably my favorite of the group</p> <p><strong>Pawn Mower</strong> - a cool concept originally by GM Maurice Ashley. I&#39;ve generated my own puzzles -- some are harder than others.</p> <p><strong>Knightmare Swap</strong> - adaptation of a puzzle that appeared in an NYT article last month, and the inspiration for this website.</p> <p><strong>Copycat</strong> - a little riddle to complete the rank.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>All games have drag and drop enabled (including the Knight Tour game so you don&#39;t have to type numbers if you don&#39;t want to). Some games you can just click/tap the square without dragging if there&#39;s a valid move for that square.</p> <p>Rank 2 will be themed <em>&quot;React&quot;</em>, and is intended to help with building intuition. It should be more fun and have a &quot;practice range&quot; kind of feel. </p> <p>The website is in its nascent stages, so if there&#39;s any issues let me know. I tested on my phone and desktop (on tablets it might not look too good right now, at least in portrait mode).</p> <p><a href="https://sixtyfour.pro">Site link</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nihilistiq"> /u/nihilistiq </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wg4ztu/making_a_site_for_chess_mini_games_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wg4ztu/making_a_site_for_chess_mini_games_and/">[comments]</a></span>
