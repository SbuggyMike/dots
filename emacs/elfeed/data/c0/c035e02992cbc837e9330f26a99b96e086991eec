Allowing business to
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/free-market-dogma-leads-to-disaster">optimize everything with profit</a>
as its only goal
has produced disaster over and over.

Railroads, masks, medicine, arms &mdash; every area of work that has been
put under the dominion of the profit-maximizer works badly for everyone
except the owners.  A profit-maximizing AI will be little different from
a paperclip-maximizing AI.
