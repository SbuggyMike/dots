<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware that previous touchpad driver (synaptic) had bugged kinetic scroll, like scrolling wont stop even if user move cursor to another window. But I was playing with my friend&#39;s MacBook and saw apple&#39;s implementation of kinetic scroll: you easily scroll with two fingers, but if you move cursor scrolling stops, so there&#39;s cannot be such bug as synaptics one So I asked myself why did not implement this elegant solution to libinput (as far as I know it&#39;s future and Wayland etc), and now asking you, community I would happily make some mr to this, or at least make fork for it, but I know for sure that I have not enough knowledge and abilities to do this, maybe someone would want to do this, I will help if I can (even tho I don&#39;t know if there is something useful I can do)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nobilis_luceat"> /u/nobilis_luceat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w2dyzc/so_why_not_to_implement_kinetic_scroll_in_libinput/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w2dyzc/so_why_not_to_implement_kinetic_scroll_in_libinput/">[comments]</a></span>
