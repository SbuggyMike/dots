*Let's Acknowledge Why the Midterms Look So Bleak for Democrats: <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/07/25/lets-acknowledge-why-midterms-look-so-bleak-democrats-joe-biden">Joe

I can't say I am entirely sure that this is true.  The reason why I am
not sure is because voters' thinking seems to be irrational.  Why let
your opinion of Biden affect whether to vote for your local
progressive candidate?

Biden or no Biden, it's clear that the only way to get progressive
laws through Congress is to elect more progressives to Congress.  The
2022 elections are an opportunity to do this &mdash; so what are we waiting
for?

Since I can't make sense of what those voters are thinking, I can't model
what would influence them.  But the article could be right.
