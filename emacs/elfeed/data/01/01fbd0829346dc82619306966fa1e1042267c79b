<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hej fellows,</p> <p>recently <a href="/u/protesilaos">u/protesilaos</a> published an excellent package called Denote which provides a simple interface to note taking. Coming from an ugly hyrolo file and dreading the hidden complexities of org-roam, I rejoice this development.</p> <p>Now, I have been wanting to implement a workflow that allows me to export my notes to other formats such as ODT and PDF, so that I can share what I write down with other, non-tech-savvy people (my notes contain my knowledge database). </p> <p>However, I have some requirements for this: </p> <ul> <li>I want to produce a continuous file which contains parts or the entirety of my knowledge database. </li> <li>I want each note to have a separate heading.</li> <li>I want each heading to feature the tags I associate with a particular note.</li> </ul> <p>Now, I know that there is an org-export facility or pandoc. However, in about two hours research I have not found out how to do what I want specifically for exporting Denote&#39;s notes.</p> <p>Denote uses four keywords at the start of each note: TITLE, DATE, (FILE)TAGS, IDENTIFIER. When exporting, I want that DATE and IDENTIFIER keywords are (can be) omitted. However, I want that the contents of the TITLE keyword are (automatically) transformed into a regular heading. Also, I want that the FILETAGS are included as a sub-heading. </p> <p>I have more experience with latex than I have with markdown/pandoc, let&#39;s get a tiny bit more concrete: I&#39;d like to be able to transform the contents of the TITLE keyword into a latex <code>\chapter</code> (not the document&#39;s title, that won&#39;t work when collating several notes) and the contents of the FILETAGS keyword into a latex <code>\paragraph</code>, leaving the actual contents of the note itself untouched.</p> <p>Since I am new to programming and not versed with either org-mode (or its export), latex or pandoc, I am at a loss as to how to approach the problem. So the following would be really helpful to me:</p> <ul> <li><strong>ideas on how to tackle the problem programmatically</strong>: is this a problem to be heavy-lifted by org-latex-export alone, or do I need to effect the transformations beforehand? or is pandoc the right approach?</li> <li><strong>suggestions on whether org-mode or markdown is the easier route to success</strong>: I am currently in the process of transitioning from an old and kinda deficient notes system to a new one. Thus, I am willing to invest the time learning either org-mode or markdown more in-depth as soon as I know it will be able to do what I want.</li> <li><strong>suggestions regarding (learning) resources related to the problem</strong>: I did my best to be clear and concise in what I want. Obviously I won&#39;t say no to a bit of spoon-feeding, but I am just as glad to read into related resources. In my own research I was unable to find the information I need, so anything is welcome here.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks a bunch in advance. Have a good day, folks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/olivuser"> /u/olivuser </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wayvwh/how_to_export_denote_notes_to_pdfs_with_specific/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wayvwh/how_to_export_denote_notes_to_pdfs_with_specific/">[comments]</a></span>
