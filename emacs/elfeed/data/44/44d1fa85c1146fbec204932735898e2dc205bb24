Students: *We're planning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/26/school-strikes-climate-protests-activists">school strikes across the world</a> to protest
climate inaction.*

This is entirely reasonable, for those who realize that <a href="/glossary.html#global%20heating">global heating</a> disaster
will not leave them much of a chance to use their studies.

Sad to say, their web site depends so totally on JavaScript code that
it shows no information with JavaScript disabled.  It's as much as to
require, arbitrarily, that you can't support your own freedom and
their campaign too.  Why create a gratuitous conflict between these
two causes, when fundamentally they are entirely compatible?
<p>
If you are in contact with them, please offer to make their site
work at least minimally for users that reject JavaScript code.

If you attend a school where an occupation is planned, I expect you
will be hear about it in other ways, so that you can support it.
