Punishing people for not participating in some sort of repression is a
standard fascist tactic, and you can gauge how fascist a party is by
whether it has recourse to that.  The Republican Party has turned
thoroughly fascist, but Democrats have supported fascist policies in

There has been a law since the 1990s under which employers could not

to work in the US.  This imposition of government control and
surveillance over life makes me boil.
