Poland's abortion restrictions killed Izabela Sajbor.  Her doctors
knew she needed an abortion to survive, but they had to

Pszczyna is around 1-2 hours' drive from the border with the Czech
Republic.  I wonder if it was possible to save her, while she was in
labor but not dying, by putting her in a car and taking her to a Czech
hospital.  Doctors surely would have said it was too risky for her to
travel, and I suppose it was; but I think they were not reckoning with
the risk for her of staying put.
