<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If I type `sshx:` after typing the colon I&#39;ll get prompted for my local machine&#39;s password, like I should normally. But then if I try to type the username and IP of the remote machine, every single character I type causes Tramp to ask me for the local machine password again. I have to hit ESC to show the original Tramp prompt again. Typing another character asks for the password again. You get the idea.</p> <p>Has anyone else had this? I don&#39;t even know where to look to know what to fix.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/theoryfiver"> /u/theoryfiver </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w29gjf/need_help_tramp_asks_for_password_after_every/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w29gjf/need_help_tramp_asks_for_password_after_every/">[comments]</a></span>
