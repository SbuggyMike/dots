<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Vacation ends tomorrow and so the time for my summer project. This summer I decided to learn a bit of music / guitar theory as I&#39;ve played guitar for some time but never learned any theory. Ended up making a small web app that can display chords, scales, modes and chord progressions. The app can generate questions and answers in an Org drill (a mode for Emacs) format. Feedback is much appreciated! &lt;3</p> <p><a href="https://jherrlin.github.io/guitar-theory-training/">https://jherrlin.github.io/guitar-theory-training/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jherrlin"> /u/jherrlin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w6d3jb/guitar_theory_with_org_drill/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w6d3jb/guitar_theory_with_org_drill/">[comments]</a></span>
