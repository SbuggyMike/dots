<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently running emacs 29 (built from emacs-29 branch) which – according to <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot">https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot</a> – should contain the latest eglot.</p> <p>Now they added the eglot-upgrade-eglot command, which is supposed to update to the latest ELPA version.</p> <p>Looking into emacs-29 code, the version is currently 1.12.29, while list-packages shows version 1.15 (gnu), so installing the package might also bring in a newer one.</p> <p>I have no idea how to keep up with the latest version (without having to call the package specific eglot-upgrade-eglot function), especially when emacs 29 will be released and I won’t build from source any more.</p> <p>I followed the emacs-devel discussion (<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2023-04/msg00782.html">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2023-04/msg00782.html</a>), but now I’m even more confused. Any advice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/a_kurth"> /u/a_kurth </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/139f8r9/eglot_upgrade_strategy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/139f8r9/eglot_upgrade_strategy/">[comments]</a></span>
