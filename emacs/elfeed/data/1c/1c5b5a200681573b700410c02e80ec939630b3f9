<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am using Emacs with Spacemacs right now on my Mac and it is mostly OK but there are certainly some issues when it comes to things like bad out-of-the-box macOS integration when it comes to things like file permissions, unimplemented tabs on macOS - although they work on Linux, some scrolling render refresh bugs, buggy window resizing, and the list goes, unfortunately, on... ;)</p> <p>Aquamacs apparently seems to have all this fixed and tailored for the Mac while giving you the option to customize things to perhaps even Spacemacs like experience - most of Spacemacs is really just packages setup to work nicely together.</p> <p>Also, Aquamacs people say that they even plan a separate Apple Silicon version (M1,M2) of Aquamacs (= better performance and longer battery) which is probably never gonna happen with the regular GNU Emacs. Or maybe I am wrong?</p> <p>BUT... maybe... there are some cons? And perhaps some are a dealbreaker preventing me to migrate from Emacs/Spacemacs to Aquamacs?</p> <p>For people who have used Aquamacs, what has been your experience? What are are pros and cons against a regular Emacs? Were there any dealbreakers?</p> <p>Also, how is it running Aquamacs and regular Emacs (with Spacemacs) on the same computer/user account? Will they play along nicely and don&#39;t mess things up, or they will be rewriting each others&#39; configs all the time?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/East_Staff3288"> /u/East_Staff3288 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w54gkg/cons_of_aquamacs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w54gkg/cons_of_aquamacs/">[comments]</a></span>
