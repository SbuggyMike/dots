<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a more recent Linux user (about 4 months) and one of the things I&#39;m struggling with is over updating. Essentially every time I sit down my brain goes &quot;oops! Better check for updates! Wouldn&#39;t want to be out of date!&quot; And even I can say I&#39;m being excessive. I use Debian/Debian based distros, so those aren&#39;t as bleeding edge as others. How often do you <em>need</em> to update to stay safe? Would I be able to go a week? A month? A year, without updating? I know the Arch guys update every other second, but for something less bleeding edge, what would you say would be a proper amount of time before checking for updates, or updating your system?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Breude"> /u/Breude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vyhox4/how_often_do_you_update_your_system/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vyhox4/how_often_do_you_update_your_system/">[comments]</a></span>
