<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was doing nothing out of the ordinary the other day, just booting up my desktop PC and opening Firefox as usual. When I opened Firefox, the whole system just started freezing and becoming completely unresponsive.</p> <p>I had to use the physical reset button. :-(</p> <p>I rebooted, opened Firefox, and again this happened. I used the reset button again. (The pain, ugh.)</p> <p>Usually this doesn&#39;t cause any issues (probably just lucky), but after the 100th time I guess, I was not so lucky.</p> <p>Next boot, I&#39;m greeted with drop to TTY emergency shell kind of deal, no login screen. It says something about my disk not being in a good state. Should&#39;ve written it down but I thought I&#39;d be able to fix it.</p> <p>I duckduckgo around a bunch, trying to find different solutions to this. I find this page talking about <code>btrfs check --repair</code>. I ran it. (I know, I know...)</p> <p>It fixed it! I was able to boot into the partition again.</p> <p>Now I can&#39;t remember if Firefox gave me issues again or if I just rebooted again to make sure it works as it&#39;s supposed to. It did not. After that one last boot, I was not able to mount the partition again, even after running that same repair command.</p> <p>I&#39;ve since installed a new NVMe disk in here and I&#39;m typing this through a new installation which I intend to keep. But when I try to mount the partition again, I&#39;m getting this from <code>dmesg</code>:</p> <pre><code>[17302.674033] BTRFS info (device nvme0n1p6): using crc32c (crc32c-intel) checksum algorithm [17302.674042] BTRFS info (device nvme0n1p6): disk space caching is enabled [17302.687385] BTRFS error (device nvme0n1p6): parent transid verify failed on logical 1095761920 mirror 1 wanted 2092594 found 2092598 [17302.687394] BTRFS error (device nvme0n1p6): failed to read block groups: -5 [17302.687748] BTRFS error (device nvme0n1p6): open_ctree failed [17311.045576] BTRFS: device fsid 67e940b3-f715-438a-96d6-52bbd7a3d6a5 devid 1 transid 2092598 /dev/nvme0n1p6 scanned by mount (57794) [17311.050631] BTRFS info (device nvme0n1p6): using crc32c (crc32c-intel) checksum algorithm [17311.050637] BTRFS info (device nvme0n1p6): disk space caching is enabled [17311.065665] BTRFS error (device nvme0n1p6): parent transid verify failed on logical 1095761920 mirror 1 wanted 2092594 found 2092598 [17311.065680] BTRFS error (device nvme0n1p6): failed to read block groups: -5 [17311.066109] BTRFS error (device nvme0n1p6): open_ctree failed </code></pre> <p>Anybody have any idea of what might be the issue, or if it&#39;s fixable (again)?</p> <p>I have some precious photos I&#39;d like to recover, like the ultrasound of my second child e.g., and tons of markdown notes with gift ideas for my wife and kids and TODOs of things that need doing and purchasing, etc. &lt;3 Very thankful for any help on this, even if it&#39;s &quot;you&#39;re screwed&quot;.
