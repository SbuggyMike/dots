<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was originally posted on <a href="/r/Windows10">r/Windows10</a>, i&#39;ve decided to repost it here just in case it can help anyone, so here&#39;s the original title:</p> <p>How do i move a 512 Mb Fat partition i have never created out of the way so i can enlarge another one?</p> <p>Body:</p> <p>Hello everyone, i&#39;m sorry but today my computer decided that it wants to speak italian on it&#39;s own, so i will have to translate the following picture.</p> <p>I know, this community is for windows 10, but this problem was born with windows, even though the partition i want to expand is an ext4 linux file system (which i will enlarge in linux).</p> <p>Please keep in mind that i am talking about the 500 Gb ssd. The first partition is &quot;System reserver&quot;, and uses 579 Mb formatted with NTFS. The second one is C:, The black empty space is space that i got out of c, E: is a weird partition that got created on its own, and i have absoloutely no idea of what that is for. There are no files in there, and i cant expand it or shrink it. I just want to move that black unallocated space close to the 112 Gb ext4 partition so i can enlarge it. What should i do? I am afraid that it&#39;s some kind of boot thing, even though i use MBR, not GPT! My dream would be freeing that MBR primary partition and absoloutely anhillating it. Can i do it?</p> <p>Once again, this is straight out of that post, I don&#39;t know if posting it here is appropriate but after having cried on this crappy partition i really feel in moral debt of explaining how to fix this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PsychologicalPark266"> /u/PsychologicalPark266 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wdumgc/here_is_how_to_move_the_weird_513_mb_efi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wdumgc/here_is_how_to_move_the_weird_513_mb_efi/">[comments]</a></span>
