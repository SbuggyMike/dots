A "global energy price cap" could cut Putin's fossil fuel income.
This article explains how it would function, 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/28/global-energy-price-cap-g7-proposal">by conditions on insurance

I wonder if China might defeat it by offering insurance without
insisting on the price limit.
