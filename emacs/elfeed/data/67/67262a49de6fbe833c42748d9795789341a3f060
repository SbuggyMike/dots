A large music festival in Atlanta has been cancelled because Georgia
does not permit 
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/entertainment/atlanta-music-festival-canceled/index.html">music festivals in parks to exclude guns.</a>

The direct cause of cancellation seems to be that Atlanta refused to
authorized it, but I expect the city invited the festival to change
its rules to permit guns in order to get approval.  I expect that the
organizers were wise to stand by their policy.
