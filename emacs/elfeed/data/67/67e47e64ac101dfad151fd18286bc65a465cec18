<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been learning piano for almost 10 years and I have basic knowledge of music theory, but I really want to get into composing. I know it takes a lot of time and practice, but right now I&#39;m looking for beginner/intermediate course recommendations for music theory and composition that aren&#39;t too long or pricey which can help me get started. Any help is very appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/allthatmelted"> /u/allthatmelted </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/130nsxq/online_music_theory_course_recs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/130nsxq/online_music_theory_course_recs/">[comments]</a></span>
