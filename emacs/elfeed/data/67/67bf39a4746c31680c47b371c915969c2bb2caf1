Civil liberties activists called for governments to decide <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/journalists-ban-pegasus-spyware">not to allow
    spy software</a> such as Pegasus.

I wish getting rid of spy software were that easy, but I don't think
it is.  When programs have bugs, some people will exploit them as
security holes, and just saying "That's prohibited" won't stop it.

Indeed, gangs do this and they are probably breaking a law by doing
so, but that doesn't faze them &mdash; they break many other laws too.
