<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I am using NetworkManager, and am able to successfully connect to my and other&#39;s home wifi and was able to connect to the public library wifi.</p> <p>However, I tried to connect to my jobs public wifi today (I work at a community college) using nmtui. While it said I had successfully connected , I could not ping <a href="https://debian.org">debian.org</a> (my usual tester) or browse the internet but I could ping <a href="https://8.8.8.8">8.8.8.8</a> . This was just a public wifi with no sign-in page or anything. I used to be able to use the wifi there fine using this same install.</p> <p>I&#39;ve done a lot of searching online but I am having trouble isolating my problem. (A lot of people have had similar issues for a variety of reasons).</p> <p>Any thoughts on where I should start for diagnosing this? I was going through the Networking page on the arch wiki and seeing if my config files looked okay. I&#39;d like to develop the skills for fixing this in case I run into it again, I had a similar problem at the college I attend for school.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Thank you in advance, I try to avoid bothering people on forums until I really hit a wall. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/massivehater"> /u/massivehater </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wap3uf/some_public_wifis_work_whereas_others_do_not_not/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wap3uf/some_public_wifis_work_whereas_others_do_not_not/">[comments]</a></span>
