<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m collecting information on basic Org mode assist in tools that are not Emacs. I already have: GitHub, GitLab (exactly like GitHub), OrgModeWeb, Orgzly, Orgro, Emacs, vim-orgmode. What I need is information on much more tools. I have set up <a href="https://github.com/novoid/github-orgmode-tests/blob/master/orgmode_support.org">a syntax checking file on GitHub</a> which also contains my current compatibility table for the most basic set that makes sense as a Markdown-pendant outside of Emacs according to my subjective judgement on Org mode at the bottom. My focus is on tools that - at least - offer text formatting syntax highlighting for <code>*bold* /italic/</code> and so forth. The rest could be &quot;works as text but has no special support for outlining and more&quot;. The goals is to emphasize that there are much more tools ‏‏‎ that allow for viewing and/or editing data in Org mode syntax. Since I don&#39;t have an iPhone, iOS-based tools supporting Org mode syntax is very much appreciated. Please do hand in more lines for the table either here, via email or as a GitHub pull request. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The9thHuman"> /u/The9thHuman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wezx0d/help_requested_support_for_basic_org_mode_support/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wezx0d/help_requested_support_for_basic_org_mode_support/">[comments]</a></span>
