<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Archers,</p> <p>less than two years ago I published a bash script that can that downloads a package from the Arch repository or from ChaoticAUR with all its dependences, and this was a big success for me on this community and on github. Later someone else, inspired by this project, have developed <a href="https://github.com/hanzala123/arch2appimage">its own tool</a> with a better code and easier to use (DT on YouTube did also a review on it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtnm7VFXWzI">here</a>). Everithing is great, I&#39;m glad about all this, but... I stopped work on my repo more than 1 year ago (about december 2021) for a reason, the same that I think the developer of arch2appimage have understand later (and I said it into an issue, <a href="https://github.com/hanzala123/arch2appimage/issues/25">here</a>), that&#39;s why its project have no more commits since 9 months. Arch-based AppImages are not a good idea, here are two reasons:</p> <ol> <li>If you don&#39;t care about other GNU/Linux distributions other than Arch Linux this is futile for you, Stable and LTS systems have not a compatible version of GLIBC, the more the version of GLIBC is old, the more we have compatibility with all the other distributions... but again, this is not a problem of the Arch users that care only about Arch;</li> <li>The second reason is the &quot;modularity&quot; of Arch, why Debian packages all the dependences in many different packages? Because a developer can isolate a bug or exclude that package using the right patch. Arch tends to package everything together. That&#39;s why an AppImage of Chromium for me is about 140 MB from a Ubuntu base and 280-300 from an Arch-base... but at least this is an issue of both arch-deployer and arch2appimage... I think that by using <a href="https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt">linuxdeployqt</a> would be better in this case (SPOILER, it requires the host system with an old GLIBC version, also Debian Bookwork is too new for it xD ).</li> </ol> <p>Anyway, I still see people giving me &quot;Stars&quot; for my project and I&#39;m glad about this, also if now it is abandoned: thank you so much for this.</p> <p>I&#39;m working on my AppImages by using deb packages, PPAs or other third-party repositories and they seems to work well (until the next bug report I receive, at least). Stay sure that I&#39;ll work also on other projects related to Arch, including Junest and similar... but I&#39;ll no more work on arch-deployer, I think it is useless (for non-arch users, at least).</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/am-ivan"> /u/am-ivan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138jvh4/two_reasons_because_archbased_appimages_are_not_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138jvh4/two_reasons_because_archbased_appimages_are_not_a/">[comments]</a></span>
