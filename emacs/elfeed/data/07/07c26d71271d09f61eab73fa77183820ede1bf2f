<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From the btrfswiki (<a href="https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-man5.html">https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-man5.html</a>) </p> <p><code>Note: most mount options apply to the whole filesystem and only options in the first mounted subvolume will take effect. This is due to lack of implementation and may change in the future. This means that (for example) you canâ€™t set per-subvolume nodatacow, nodatasum, or compress using mount options. This should eventually be fixed, but it has proved to be difficult to implement correctly within the Linux VFS framework.</code></p> <p>I was looking to see if it was fixed today, and I didn&#39;t see it stated anywhere on the arch wiki.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoCSForYou"> /u/NoCSForYou </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wf5xup/most_btrfs_mounting_options_are_across_the_whole/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wf5xup/most_btrfs_mounting_options_are_across_the_whole/">[comments]</a></span>
