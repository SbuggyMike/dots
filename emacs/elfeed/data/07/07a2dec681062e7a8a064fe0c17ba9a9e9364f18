The Tories plan to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/19/britain-boiling-jet-zero-aviation-strategy-uk-expand-heatwave-climate-crisis">promote more flying</a> in the UK, presuming that
future technology will eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions of all
those flights.

Betting on future technology to reduce the greenhouse emissions of
common activities is utterly foolish.  Lobbyists always present such a bet
as a sure thing, or close enough one can treat it as a sure thing.
They are surely exaggerating, and we must not trust them.
