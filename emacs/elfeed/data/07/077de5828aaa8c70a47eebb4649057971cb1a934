Verisign has asked ICANN to give
<a href="https://freespeech.com/2023/04/19/red-alert-icann-and-verisign-proposal-would-allow-any-government-in-the-world-to-seize-domain-names/"><em>every</em> government total power</a>
to seize or shut .net domains.
  If some government, such as Tuvalu or China or Beijing, seized your
domain, you'd have to sue in the courts of Tuvalu or China, not your
own country.
<p>
This is a very dangerous concentration of power.  The fact that Verisign
arranged for this shows it is far too powerful.  The network's arrangements
with it should be canceled and replaced with something quite different.
<p>
The fact that ICANN agreed to this suggests that there is corruption in ICANN
that needs to be rooted out.
