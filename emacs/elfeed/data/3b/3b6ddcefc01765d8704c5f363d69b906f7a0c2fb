The Suicide Six ski lodge is changing it's name because people criticized
use of the word 
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/suicide-six-ski-resort-new-name-saskadena-vermont">"suicide" as insensitive.</a>
<p>
I firmly oppose the campaign to make such words unacceptable to use.
It was already going too far to demand everyone avoid any word that
someone might take offense at. But this pressure demands even more.
It demands we tiptoe through life, always timid because of possible
sensitivity.

I can imagine the same critics demanding that the Grateful Dead change it's name &mdash; or else, that radio stations boycott it's music.
