<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Before we criticize Pakistan Women’s cricket, let&#39;s have a look at Men’s team when it was in a DEVELOPING PHASE to know how much time it requires to build a team irrespective of gender.</p> <p>Between 1960 and 1972, Pakistan Men won 2 out of 35 Tests - the worst team in the world.</p> <p>For those who have a problem with Bismah Maroof’s batting average (29 in ODIs and 27 in T20Is), Pakistan’s first cricket captain Abdul Hafeez Kardar averaged only 23 in 26 Tests still he was one of the first cricket heroes in the country and rightly so.</p> <p>Because if you focus on averages alone it will make you miss the larger picture – like Kardar was a fatherly figure and an inspiration for many budding cricketers of his generation, Bismah, even though she is not the first captain, is playing the same role for this generation and aspiring many girls to take up the sport.</p> <p>In a country and culture where most women have to make a choice between being a housewife and working woman, Bismah has shown them the way to do both. </p> <p>Pakistan Men were the worst performing team in 1960s and early 1970s but in 1980s they became number one in Test Rankings and a few years later won the World Cup too. It was a 30-40 years process. </p> <p>For those who want Pakistan Women to perform like England and Australia Women. Let’s not forget that their women have been playing for nearly 90 years whereas Pakistan Women started only 25 years ago and got central contracts only about 10 years ago. </p> <p>Pakistan Men did have some big moments occasionally at the start – like winning a Test at The Oval in 1954. So did women – beating India twice in T20 World Cups in 2012 and 2016. In fact, Pakistan Women beat India in World Cup before Men did [in 2021]. </p> <p>For any team in cricket, be it men or women, it requires time to reach maturity. Afghanistan Men for example have been playing for more than a decade now but they are yet to win an international match against Top 6 teams. </p> <p>There is no comparison here but the aforementioned facts are good enough examples to understand that establishing a good and competitive cricket team is a decades long process and requires lot of working on grassroot levels and domestic infrastructure.</p> <p>What Pakistan need to do is bring more women’s fixtures at the domestic levels with improved facilities. Squads with no upward pressure for places are unlikely to develop.</p> <p>If there is a criticism on the way Pakistan Women are playing (selections, strategy etc), that’s acceptable. But in the recent months, there have been vile comments like these players should be in kitchen or women cricket is not good enough to be played. That’s not acceptable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mazherarshad"> /u/mazherarshad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wdd3qq/is_criticism_on_pakistan_womens_cricket_justified/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wdd3qq/is_criticism_on_pakistan_womens_cricket_justified/">[comments]</a></span>
