Some people love paradoxes and seek opportunities to claim that they
are the whole of reality.  For instance, it turns out that color
perception is partially socially constructed.   One writer leaps from
that to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/08/the-big-idea-why-colour-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder">claim that color perceptions are arbitrary mental constructs</a>
which have nothing to do with reality.

Plenty of aspects of human perception, thought, and behavior are
partially socially constructed, but that doesn't mean they are arbitrary
or that they are not constrained by reality.
