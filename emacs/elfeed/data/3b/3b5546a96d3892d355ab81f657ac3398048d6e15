<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I would gladly receive advice on some good pieces similar to Handel&#39;s Keyboard Suites. I&#39;ve mostly been enjoying the famous n.7, n.8, n.15 and n.16. It doesn&#39;t necessairly have to be Harpsicord/Piano music, I really enjoyed the passacaille arrangement for violin and viola.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NaturaNaturans3"> /u/NaturaNaturans3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wf6ug6/music_like_handels_keyboard_suites/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wf6ug6/music_like_handels_keyboard_suites/">[comments]</a></span>
