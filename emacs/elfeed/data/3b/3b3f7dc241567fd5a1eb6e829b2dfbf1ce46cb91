Canadian thugs used to grab indigenous men in the city at random, take
them by car to the woods, then leave them to freeze to death.  One
victim,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/25/darrell-night-who-exposed-canada-police-freezing-deaths-scandal-dies-at-56">Darrell Night, was able to survive and blew the whistle</a>
on
this practice of murder for fun.

It's not too late to prosecute some of the murderers, if the government
has the spine for it.
