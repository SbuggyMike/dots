US citizens: call on Transportation Secretary Buttigieg to <a href="https://act.demandprogress.org/sign/usdot-airlines/?t=1001&akid=29270%2E96703%2EA4hL4I">protect
passengers and crack down on airline malpractice.</a>

It's much less painful to find, in advance, that no space is available for
your trip, than to get a ticket but learn, at the airport, that you can't
actually travel.  Fining airlines for the latter will teach airlines not to
schedule more flights than they can actually operate.
