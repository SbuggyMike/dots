<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Olympiad this year without Russia and China is a potential chance for other strong countries to medal, such as France. However out of the top French GMs, none of Firouzja, MVL and Bacrot are attending. </p> <p>First Firouzja was said to have withdrawn due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/uxmecq/fressinet_hints_that_firouzja_wont_be_playing_in/">busy schedule</a>. Afterwards, MVL also withdrew citing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/vqcy3s/mvl_on_why_france_wont_have_its_top_players_in/">hot weather</a>. Gustafsson <a href="https://youtu.be/nGvZXXEnonQ?t=9492">suggested</a> on the SuperUnited broadcast this week that there might be other underlying issues which Fressinet (part of Team France) wouldn&#39;t talk about:</p> <blockquote> <p>also with Alireza of course I have no clue what was debated or agreed, but often when you change federations... I&#39;m guessing the FCF was involved...then it&#39;s part of the the deal that you play for the national team no? But maybe it wasn&#39;t. I have no clue. I was just curious, as France with Alireza and Maxime would be such a powerhouse. The second strongest team at this olympiad for sure...</p> </blockquote> <p>I saw a suggestion that the tension is financial, not sure if this has basis. Does anyone here know something about it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/clementiiines"> /u/clementiiines </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w871wz/whats_going_on_in_the_french_chess_federation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w871wz/whats_going_on_in_the_french_chess_federation/">[comments]</a></span>
