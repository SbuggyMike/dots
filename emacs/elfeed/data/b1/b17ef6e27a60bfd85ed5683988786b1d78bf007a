<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I received a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4s yesterday. I wanted to pair them with my Arch desktop, so that I could use LDAC to get the full capability out of these things.</p> <p>I&#39;ve previously owned the WH-XB900N headphones, and those also support LDAC. Pipewire thankfully makes LDAC pretty easy, and I didn&#39;t have any issues with those.</p> <p>When I paired the headphones to my arch install, it ONLY shows the Headset HSP/HFP profiles. No High Fidelity audio options. The mic is on, and the headphones are stuck in headset mode.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried everything, and I cannot get it to go into an A2DP mode. I&#39;ve unpaired and repaired them over and over, I&#39;ve factory reset the headphones, updated pipewire, and tried to use the command line to force the audio profile. Nothing. </p> <p>I connected my WH-XB900Ns, and they immediately connected via LDAC, and showed a whole host of other codec options.</p> <p>Weirdly, when I put them into simultaneous device mode, where two devices can be connected at the same time (but also disables LDAC), it works, and I can use AAC to listen to audio.</p> <p>I tried pairing them to my Mac, and they connected via AAC just fine, without being in simultaneous device mode. The issue seems isolated to my arch install.</p> <p>Pulling my hair out over this, would appreciate any guidance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/please_respect_hats"> /u/please_respect_hats </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vy4g5p/really_odd_issue_with_pairing_sony_wh1000xm4/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vy4g5p/really_odd_issue_with_pairing_sony_wh1000xm4/">[comments]</a></span>
