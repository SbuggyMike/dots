<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious as to if there is anyway to update an outdated keyring for an installation iso without reflashing the entire thing. (during installation specifically) When I google it the only results I find are from people who need to update the keyring for their system, I can&#39;t actually find any evidence of someone updating a keyring for an installation medium.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/temmiesayshoi"> /u/temmiesayshoi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wi2ltx/can_you_update_the_keyring_of_an_installation_iso/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wi2ltx/can_you_update_the_keyring_of_an_installation_iso/">[comments]</a></span>
