<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: sorry for not responding to any of these. I started testing some of these yesterday and have thoughts, but probably 15 minutes after I posted this my wife called and said our car died. Took it to the shop and they said it was going to be $5,000+ to repair. So I ended yesterday with a new (to me) car that I overpaid for. It was a long stressful day, but your responses are really appreciated here and I’ll do some testing and see what fits for me. </p> <p>—————————————————————————— Right now I’m running one called Tabby, and the functionality that I want is pretty much all there, but it’s so incredibly slow. I’m assuming because of the cross platform architecture its built on. </p> <p>My favorite terminal app is iTerm2 for mac, but seeing as I need something for Ubuntu at the moment, that won’t work. </p> <p>I would love some recommendations and thoughts on your experiences with different apps.</p> <p>Features of iTerm2 that I really love:</p> <p>Saving sessions / session details to quickly connect to different servers. </p> <p>The ability to set colors / themes based on which server I’m currently connected to </p> <p>Split screen and tabbed interfaces. </p> <p>Color coded output</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BokehJunkie"> /u/BokehJunkie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w58px4/whats_everyones_favorite_terminal_app_right_now/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w58px4/whats_everyones_favorite_terminal_app_right_now/">[comments]</a></span>
