<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was reading music criticism articles by Alejo Carpentier. As many of you know, Carpentier was a cuban author and musicogist.... A great novelist, by the way... Well... Carpentier said that many russian composers found in folcloric and orientalism topics what they never could find in their own traditions... I know that the termn &quot;own traditions&quot; is very tricky... But let me continue... In Carpentier&#39;s opinion, french and specially german composers looked in to musicial theory and tried to redefine aspects like armony, while The Mighty Five was riding horses in the steppes of central asia... I think that it&#39;s a simplist aproach, but still interersting. I would love to read your comments and if it&#39;s possible some references related to this matter</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shostakovich1941"> /u/Shostakovich1941 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/whq92n/russian_orientalism/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/whq92n/russian_orientalism/">[comments]</a></span>
