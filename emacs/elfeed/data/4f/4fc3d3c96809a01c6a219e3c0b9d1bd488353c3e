<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So this was when I was younger like 12 years ago. I was just 14 then. I was out playing with my friends cricket in the neighbourhood park. We had just got a new cork ball. For those unaware it is like a ball but just made of hard stone. If that thing catches speed it can break some arms or legs. I was fielding in the edges of the boundary. There were 2 little girls playing at a little distance from us. These 2 were younger than us might be just 7-8 years old only. </p> <p>So here is what happened, the ball was caught by me and I had to throw it towards the stumps. I don’t know what happened but my throw was horribly wrong directioned. The ball went between the two little girls and very near the head of one of them. Though it didn’t touch them at all but it was very near to their heads. I could see the elder one’s shock and horror at this.</p> <p>The little one just kept playing even though it was nearer to her head.</p> <p>To this day I sometimes remember that happening as clear as it was yesterday. How close that was. That rock ball could have easily cracked open that kid’s head. Death was a very near possibility.</p> <p>I think what would have happened?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mojo118"> /u/mojo118 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/vyq102/hard_to_forget/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/vyq102/hard_to_forget/">[comments]</a></span>
