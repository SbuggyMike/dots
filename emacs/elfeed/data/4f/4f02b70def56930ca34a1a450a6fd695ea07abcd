Australia may soon change its constitution to establish something to
be known as "an indigenous voice to parliament", 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/29/momentum-is-building-high-hopes-for-an-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-as-garma-festival-starts">though no one has
stated clearly what that would concretely mean.</a>
<p>
In general, it is wrong to establish rights or privileges for citizens
based on their racial background.  Would this "voice" do a thing?
Without a concrete plan, we can't tell.

Prime Minister Albanese has promised to state simply and clearly the
text for the referendum to decide on the plan.  Supposing that the
simple and clear text also states concretely what would be done, then
depending on those details, it might perhaps be a good thing.

The indigenous Australians suffered a grave wrong when the British
colonists took their land, and suffer from direct and systemic racism
today.  They deserve various sorts of help and compensation &mdash; but that
is a different question.
