<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just got a logitech mk550 and went to download the the logitech options software only to find out they donâ€™t support linux. Just changed to linux a couple weeks ago and this is really the first challenge ive had, can someone give some guidance on how to surpass this challenge. Would really like to be able to use the mouse buttons and remap some on the keyboard, and yes i have tried piper.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mysterious_Editor698"> /u/Mysterious_Editor698 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/way64f/logitech_options_software/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/way64f/logitech_options_software/">[comments]</a></span>
