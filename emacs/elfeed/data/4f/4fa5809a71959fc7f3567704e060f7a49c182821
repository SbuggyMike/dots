<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!<br/> I have never really listened to any of Brahms&#39;s piano music. And so I don&#39;t know it and don&#39;t even know where to start.<br/> Therefore, would you have any recommendations on which pieces to start with, and perhaps some listening guides? </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tea_Master2"> /u/Tea_Master2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/waieff/brahms_piano_music_help_needed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/waieff/brahms_piano_music_help_needed/">[comments]</a></span>
