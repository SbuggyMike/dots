*US proposes rules requiring airlines to compensate passengers for
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/08/flight-delay-compensation-cancelation-us-airlines">flight delays</a>.*
<p>
Flight delays and cancellations can't always be avoided.
But the problems they cause will be spread a lot more fairly
with these compensations.
<p>
In addition, in 2020 airlines often scheduled flights and cancelled them,
leading to suspicions that they were expecting to cancel those flights
when they announced them.  With compensation requirements like this,
they would not do that.
