<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Assuming newcomers will face difficulties no matter what (having to adapt to new alternative programs, having maybe some hardware issues, etc) I think it&#39;s a bad idea to present them a UI that is kinda-like-what-they&#39;re-used-to-but-not-really and only make things more confusing.</p> <p>Having something more carefully designed and intuitive (like gnome 40+, imo) is more beneficial. It&#39;s a hurdle to learn something from scratch but at least they have a way to mentally separate the UI from windows.</p> <p>Also I remember back in the days of being a teen a using ubuntu (gnome 2) and liking it specifically because it was different and with the cool transitions, effects, and so on.</p> <p>EDIT: I might have phrased the original post poorly (l&#39;m also not a native speaker) but what I was talking about were those discussion where people are <em>actively</em> asking recommendations on what distros to try because they are tired of Windows and/or want something new, yet people mostly recommend distros with windows-like</p> <p>I briefly mentioned gnome because that&#39;s what I have recent experience with and what I am currently impressed at. I&#39;m not saying the whole world should be using gnome.</p> <p>My point is about UI and UX in general, about Windows being crap that keeps alive layouts, menus and stuff that has been there for 30yrs but understandably cannot change in a whim cause of the huge user base, and people almost always suggesting new users (that presumably have the interest of trying new stuff) distros that look just like windows as if that&#39;s the pinnacle of usability and Linux cannot provide a better alternative</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drgeppo"> /u/drgeppo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vvwlwf/suggesting_new_users_to_use_distros_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vvwlwf/suggesting_new_users_to_use_distros_with/">[comments]</a></span>
