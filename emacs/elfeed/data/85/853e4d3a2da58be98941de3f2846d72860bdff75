Australia plans to block the use of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/27/australian-gamblers-to-be-banned-from-using-credit-cards-for-online-betting">credit cards to pay for online
gambling</a>.
  This is a wise plan since it can prevent some gambling addicts
from betting money they do not have.

I conjecture that any system that requires gamblers to declare their
intention to gamble and then wait a while will help people avoid
compulsive gambling.  Perhaps other ideas can be found from that.
