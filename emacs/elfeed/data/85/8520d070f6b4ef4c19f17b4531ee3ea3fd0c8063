<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m having a problem with my virtual bridge going UP before my ethernet device is configured (Arch automatically renames this physical device <code>eno1</code>). I can restart systemd-networkd to fix the order, but I have to do it every time I boot my Linux. Scoured the docs + Google, found nothing... thinking of making a script run on start to restart networkd but I&#39;d rather fix it than patch.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/profile_this"> /u/profile_this </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzyom0/how_can_i_force_bridge_to_wait_for_ethernet/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzyom0/how_can_i_force_bridge_to_wait_for_ethernet/">[comments]</a></span>
