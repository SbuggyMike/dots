<p>I was just poking around on a Shopify store on my Firefox browser and saw Apple Pay button showed up, first thought it's a front-end bug on the website but tapped on it and the widget slid up and you can legibly make the purchase!<p>Tried on Chrome too and it worked there too!<p>Tried a few other website and can confirm it works everywhere Apple Pay is offered. is it a feature? bug?<p>Wanna try it yourself? you can check this Stripe test page
https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button?html-or-react=html<p>Haven't installed Beta 4 yet to see if it is still working.</p>
