<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After watching CTT video on Homebrew I must say it caught my interest. I&#39;m currently running manjaro as my daily driver and couldn&#39;t be happier with it. I&#39;d like to know your experiences with it, specially those also using arch-based distros? Could it be better than AUR? worse? Can it fill for packages not available on my distro&#39;s repos?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LordKreias"> /u/LordKreias </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wjqyaj/people_that_have_used_homebrew_on_linuxlinuxbrew/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wjqyaj/people_that_have_used_homebrew_on_linuxlinuxbrew/">[comments]</a></span>
