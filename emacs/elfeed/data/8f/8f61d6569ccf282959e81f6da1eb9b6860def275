<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to install Arch in virtualbox on my windows 11 laptop (eventually I&#39;ll properly install it but for now to mess around and get the hang of it I want to have it as a VM), but I keep running into issues right off the bat.</p> <p>I&#39;m using virtualbox 6.1.34, and I&#39;ve tried the 2022.07.01, 2022.06.01, and 2022.05.01 iso images. Each time, I create a VM, set lots of memory (4GB, and 128MB vram), enable EFI, set the network adapter to Bridged, 2 processors, and mount the .iso file. I&#39;ve tried with all 3 graphics controllers available in virtualbox. these are the exact settings I have successfully installed arch in virtualbox on my desktop so they should work. I&#39;ve also done this on another laptop with no issues, which leads me to believe it&#39;s a windows problem, but I have no clue what.</p> <p>I&#39;ve checked if hyper-V or anything of the sort is enabled but these don&#39;t even show up so I don&#39;t think my laptop has them.</p> <p>anyway, when I start the VM for the first time, i select the arch install medium (uefi), and the moment the boot hits &quot;Apply Kernel Variables&quot;, it hangs, and then a bunch of start job notifications pop up - sometimes there&#39;s the error &quot;BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 55s!&quot;, sometimes it&#39;s &quot;a start job is running for load/save random seed&quot;, but there&#39;s a wide range that can show up. often if i wait long enough it does boot, and I can run through the installation, but then when I reboot the same thing happens and it never successfully reboots.</p> <p>I have absolutely no clue why this is happening and it&#39;s driving me insane. does anyone have any ideas at all? I&#39;d love to just use QEMU and virt-manager but to my knowledge they aren&#39;t available on windows (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong). and virtualbox is so easy to use... it works fine on my desktop so I really have no clue why this is happening. any help would be very much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlphaAbsol"> /u/AlphaAbsol </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w19udt/issues_with_arch_installation_image_iso_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w19udt/issues_with_arch_installation_image_iso_in/">[comments]</a></span>
