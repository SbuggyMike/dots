<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I tried updating today. Suddenly, this:</p> <pre><code>error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files) supertux: /usr/include/discord_register.h exists in filesystem (owned by discord-rpc-git) supertux: /usr/include/discord_rpc.h exists in filesystem (owned by discord-rpc-git) Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded. </code></pre> <p>The <code>discord-rpc-git</code> package is from AUR, and provides Discord&#39;s rich presence stuff by itself as its own package, and another game installed from AUR on my system depends on <code>discord-rpc</code>.</p> <p>I figured I should report this somewhere, but I&#39;m not sure where&#39;s best to; the bug reporting form does not have a category for community repo packages lol</p> <p>EDIT: Posted it on the bug tracker: <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75368">https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75368</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Architector4"> /u/Architector4 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w27e8b/supertuxs_package_ships_discord_rich_presence_now/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w27e8b/supertuxs_package_ships_discord_rich_presence_now/">[comments]</a></span>
