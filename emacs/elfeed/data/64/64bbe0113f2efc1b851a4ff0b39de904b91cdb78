<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For some reason everyone seems to have an extreme hate of chromium based browsers and I don&#39;t get why. I can kinda see because most people use chromium based browsers (chrome specifically), but aside from that I don&#39;t see any reason why to hate it. You can de-google chromium with relative ease, and harden it just like Firefox or any other FOSS browser. Is there something I&#39;m just missing?</p> <p>PS: Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, most of the chromium hate I see is in Linux subreddits so I thought it would make sense to post here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ButWhatIfItQueffed"> /u/ButWhatIfItQueffed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wbq7hs/whats_up_with_the_near_constant_hate_of_chromium/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wbq7hs/whats_up_with_the_near_constant_hate_of_chromium/">[comments]</a></span>
