<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is it true that if both package B and C provides A, then pacman asks the user to pick one explicitly. However between package A and package B that provides A, pacman silently picks A?</p> <p>I just had a fresh install. pulseaudio was installed as a dependency, which could be pulled in by some gnome packages, and pacman didn&#39;t ask me ask if there was no other options. Now I find pipewire-pulse provides pulseaudio. Why pacman picked pulseaudio silently for me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/notnullnone"> /u/notnullnone </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wisx36/how_does_pacman_choose_between_package_a_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wisx36/how_does_pacman_choose_between_package_a_and/">[comments]</a></span>
