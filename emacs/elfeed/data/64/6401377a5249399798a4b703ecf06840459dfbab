<p>Stefan Kangas writes that <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-06/msg01274.html">the first pretest for Emacs 28.2 is out</a>. If you’re conservative about the Emacs version that you use but don’t mind a little bit of adventure, this is a great way to experience the next great thing and help the developers test the next stable release.</p>
<p>It won’t be a news flash to Irreal readers but this announcement once again puts the lie to the notion that Emacs is moribund. Emacs development is not only robust but continues to introduce ground breaking improvements that—eventually—get copied by the other editors to much fanfare.</p>
<p>As always, thanks to all the developers and contributors who made this release possible.</p>
