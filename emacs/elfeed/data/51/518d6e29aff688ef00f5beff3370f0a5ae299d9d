I contend that we should forbid ownership of buildings containing
housing for rent by corporations.  Or else limit how many units, or
how many buildings, any one owner can own.

The article linked to above displays symbolic bigotry by
capitalizing "black" but not "white".  (To avoid endorsing bigotry,
capitalize both words or neither one.)  I object to bigotry, and
normally I will not link to articles that promote it.  But I make
exceptions for some articles that I consider particularly important.
That article is one of these exceptions.
