<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently worked on a project that required me to automate an ssh login with terminal prompt, sending various commands and checking the result of a test after it runs. Python is not installed on our server, which uses Paramiko to automate this sort of thing. But I was easily able to create a script using the Linux program called Autoexpect, which was written by Don Libes in 1990. I just call up the script that was automatically generated by Autoexpect (or you can write your own Expect script) and it runs the commands. There are options for accepting command-line inputs, adding wait times, and other tweaks that one might need to run through the prompts correctly. Just wanted to share. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TurkeyDinner547"> /u/TurkeyDinner547 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w1ajmf/automate_terminal_input_with_expect/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w1ajmf/automate_terminal_input_with_expect/">[comments]</a></span>
