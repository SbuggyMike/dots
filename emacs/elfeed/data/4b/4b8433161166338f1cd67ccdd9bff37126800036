<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not generally a nostalgic person, and i don&#39;t have any deep music knowledge or anything but i do know what i like and in my experience, i tend to enjoy older recordings of classical pieces a lot more. Can anyone relate? Obviously this is completely anecdotal and i guess it could be placebo/ confirmation bias but try as i can, i always communicate with older intepretations a lot more for some reason. <em>Especially</em> in opera, i know next to nothing about opera but whenever i want to listen to something i look for the oldest recordings i can find.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tiny_Tim1956"> /u/Tiny_Tim1956 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13i7j2q/why_do_older_recordings_slap/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13i7j2q/why_do_older_recordings_slap/">[comments]</a></span>
