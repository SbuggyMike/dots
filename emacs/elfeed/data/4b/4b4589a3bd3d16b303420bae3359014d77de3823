<p>Bytedude has a short, simple post on how to <a href="https://www.bytedude.com/simple-inline-images-in-org-mode/">inline images in Org-mode files</a>. An ankle biter could—and in the comments, did—make a couple of immediate observations:</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>That’s really simple to do</li>
<li>It’s covered in the manual</li>
</ol>
<p>Since Irreal doesn’t countenance ankle biters, I’ll merely note that while those two observations are true, I still see a lot of questions about this so it’s worthwhile providing a simple explanation of the process.</p>
<p>If you’ve every wanted to display images in an Org file, take a look at Bytedude’s post. It’s so simple there’s no reason not to.</p>
