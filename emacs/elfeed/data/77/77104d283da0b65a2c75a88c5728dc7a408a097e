<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently got a new computer and installed fedora 36 on it, then i installed emacs via the dnf package manager and got this problem where when i press C-SPC the mark is apparently set but moving around doesn&#39;t highlight text. Not knowing what to do (I only used emacs for a few weeks prior to that), I installed the flatpak version instead, which produced the same result, I have no clue what to try next, I would appreciate any suggestion</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IcePhoneX_"> /u/IcePhoneX_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wgs8q4/highlighting_a_region_doesnt_work/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wgs8q4/highlighting_a_region_doesnt_work/">[comments]</a></span>
