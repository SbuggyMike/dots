<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>At the GNOME login screen, you have to click your profile picture to begin typing your password. Is there a way to just press space and begin typing? This is the behavior of the lock screen. I&#39;m the only user/profile on this system. I&#39;m currently running the latest Manjaro GNOME.</p> <p>P.s. as I said in the title, this is a bit of a silly question imho. I should be able to figure this out but I must be using incorrect keywords in my searches because I&#39;m getting no useful results. </p> <p>Thanks in advance btw.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Coolb4school"> /u/Coolb4school </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w1qhic/a_silly_gnome_login_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w1qhic/a_silly_gnome_login_question/">[comments]</a></span>
