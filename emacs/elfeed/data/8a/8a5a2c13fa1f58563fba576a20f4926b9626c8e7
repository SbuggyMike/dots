<p>Howdy HN, just recently made this silly typewriter variant and think some of you might enjoy it so thought I'd share.<p>Here the cursor takes no heed of what you're typing and just advances at a steady pace, with the effect that typing something reasonable-looking requires you to type at a very steady rhythm. There's also the bonus that the space character is no longer needed—you can (and kind of have to) just wait—so the keyboard minimalists among us can shave even more space off their devices. Only desktop for now.<p>It's an interesting contrast to the last one I made—which requires you to do all the heavy lifting in moving the cursor position yourself—<a href="https://oisinmoran.com/typewriter" rel="nofollow">https://oisinmoran.com/typewriter</a></p>
