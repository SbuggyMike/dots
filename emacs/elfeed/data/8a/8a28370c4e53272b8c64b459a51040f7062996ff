<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m installing arch on some older macbook pros for my school, and am running into an issue with systemd-boot. I am using archinstall, but it won&#39;t let me select any additional kernels (pressing enter on the linux-lts kernel doesn&#39;t actually select it).</p> <p>So after installing the system, I have been installing the lts kernel with <code># pacman -Syu linux-lts linux-lts-headers</code>. The kernel shows up with proper entries in /boot, however systemd-boot isn&#39;t adding it to the menu upon reboot, which it apparently should according to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd-boot#Configuration">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd-boot#Configuration</a></p> <blockquote> <p>systemd-boot will automatically check at boot time for Windows Boot Manager at the location /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/Bootmgfw.efi, UEFI shell /shellx64.efi and EFI Default Loader /EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi, as well as specially prepared kernel files found in /EFI/Linux/. When detected, corresponding entries with titles auto-windows, auto-efi-shell and auto-efi-default, respectively, will be generated. These entries do not require manual loader configuration. However, it does not auto-detect other EFI applications (unlike rEFInd), so for booting the Linux kernel, manual configuration entries must be created.</p> </blockquote> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>unless I&#39;m misunderstanding something. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>What am I doing wrong? Do I just need to add it manually? If I add it manually, do I need to manually update the .conf every time there&#39;s a kernel update?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LorenWard"> /u/LorenWard </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wdsu8j/systemdboot_not_detecting_additional_kernels/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wdsu8j/systemdboot_not_detecting_additional_kernels/">[comments]</a></span>
