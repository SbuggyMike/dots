<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So recently I created my own VPN server via a tutorial by a guy named Wolfgang on YT. I used a debian distro for the Linode server, and I would access it via SSH in terminal. I know that I fully exited my Linode server via terminal, then, in that same terminal, now on my local side, I went to install some packages via pacman. However, whenever I tried to do so, a message would appear that said something along the lines of password required and something about PAM, which is what I use to secure my linode. It would then automatically try to enter my sudo password 3 times, and then it would quit the attempts. The only reason I bring up the VPN business is because it was the first time and only instance I used PAM, so IDK how I got to my local side. Now, I thought that a simple reboot would do the trick to fix this strange occurrence, however, it did not. This video I shot shows all that I can do with my pc in it&#39;s current state. Fail2ban doesn&#39;t load at boot as you can see, and my SDDM GUI never starts. I also cannot log in via any of the tty&#39;s, and yes, &quot;josie&quot; is my correct username. I am at an absolute loss at what to do, and I don&#39;t know how to access my pc via SSH from another pc either. I would really love it if someone could please help me. Thanks!</p> <p>P.S. PC is an ACER Aspire E15 laptop, it&#39;s old, I know.</p> <p><a href="https://reddit.com/link/wexbuz/video/p5z25b89jff91/player">https://reddit.com/link/wexbuz/video/p5z25b89jff91/player</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Josie_c21"> /u/Josie_c21 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wexbuz/please_help_sos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wexbuz/please_help_sos/">[comments]</a></span>
