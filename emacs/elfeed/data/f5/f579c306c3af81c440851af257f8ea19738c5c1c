<p>Over on <a href="https://www.redhat.com">the Red Hat site</a> there’s a post that <a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/3-text-editors-compared">makes the cases for the Emacs, Vim, and Nano editors</a>. That may seem like blasphemy to some but different people do have different needs and expectations from their editors.</p>
<p>The first problem is that the post begins with the quote, “Text editors. They aren’t something that most users put a lot of thought into.” Huh!?! Sometimes it seems like that’s <i>all</i> we think about. As ESR once said, programmers spend most of their tube time in their editor so of course we spend a lot of time thinking about them.</p>
<p>I’ve used all three of those editors, although I’ve used Nano only when building a Gentoo Linux system until I could get a real editor installed. The section on Nano pretty much supports this: It’s a simple, straightforward editor that’s intuitive and easy to use. I’m not sure why any serious developer would use it other than to bootstrap a system where other editors aren’t available.</p>
<p>I thought the section on Vim was the best and most compelling. The writer, Ricardo Gerardi, makes a good case for Vim and details all its advantages. It’s fast, light weight, and has the wonderful composable command set.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Emacs section was the least persuasive. As I’ve said many times before, if you want a fast, flexible, intuitive editor, Vim is for you. If you want a programming environment that serves as a sort of operating system—or more to the point, a sort of Lisp Machine—then Emacs is for you.</p>
<p>As for Nano, I suppose you could think of it as a replacement for <code>ed</code> in those situations where you need an extremely lightweight editor to get things going but I can’t imagine using it in my day-to-day work. Of course, other folks disagree. The nice thing is that there are plenty of editors that will meet almost anyone’s needs.</p>
