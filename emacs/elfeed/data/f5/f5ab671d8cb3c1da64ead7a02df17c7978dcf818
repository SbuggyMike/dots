<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve followed the installation guide fully and am now at the point in the lvm on luks guide where I have to add kernel parameters to the boot loader. I am using systemd as my boot loader so specifically I just need to add this line:</p> <p>rd.luks.name=device-UUID=cryptlvm root=/dev/MyVolGroup/root</p> <p>I just don’t understand where to add it? Is there a specific systemd config file? Typing it into the console simply says command not found. </p> <p>I can boot to my system, it just times out at accessing my disk and doesn’t prompt me for my password. Also my mkinitcpio hooks- am I supposed to add them in the arch-chroot version of the file, or the normal version?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SentinelMultimedia"> /u/SentinelMultimedia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4qc0u/where_to_add_kernel_parameters_to_decrypt_luks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w4qc0u/where_to_add_kernel_parameters_to_decrypt_luks/">[comments]</a></span>
