<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Something is seriously wrong with Shreyas Iyer. I wouldn&#39;t want him playing International Cricket at this moment. It could do him more harm than good.</p> <p>It is a fact that Shreyas Iyer struggles with executing shots against short pitched bowling. There was a well detailed comment on DDT a couple of months back by a user, Explaining how Shreyas Iyer has tremendous awareness, He picks his moments and constructs an innings with respect to Tests. He doesn&#39;t need to play short balls, He can leave them unlike LO matches.</p> <p>The problem is, Shreyas is unable to. Neither is he playing nor leaving the short ball well.</p> <p>Leaving the short ball is the fundamental skill taught along with front foot defense when a person picks up Cricket. This is a meticulous basic.</p> <p>The method is pretty simple. Watch the ball keenly, Which gets the eyes in line. Drop the wrists as soon as possible, So as to avoid contact even by mistake. Sway away from the path after getting a measure of the line.</p> <p>Murali Vijay made a career out of this.</p> <p>Shreyas Iyer is not dropping hands. He is getting stuck in between committing to a shot or being bogged down in movement altogether. This could be due to a shoulder girdle injury as some people have hypothesized. I think it is a mental issue.</p> <p>His technique to handle the obvious short ball tactic set for him was pulling every delivery of India&#39;s Test against England in Edgbaston. What was his thought process? Did he want to outshoot a bad shooting day in basketball terminology ala Kobe Bryant? Wherein Kobe tries to take more shots than usual on a bad touch day to get into form again. The margin of error is extremely low in Cricket batting. One bad shot ends the innings. Shreyas Iyer had this elementary mindset in most of the matches in recent times.</p> <p>I personally believe attacking the short ball is zero sum investment at the Test level in the last half decade. The ball&#39;s displacement is too much to succeed consistently. Batters should keep away from the short ball unless they are in great touch or have their game primarily based on back foot pivot as is the case with South African batters.</p> <p>The talk and uncovering of his weakness has gotten into Shreyas Iyer&#39;s head. He is constantly getting into positions the opponent wants him to be in. It is not worth it. The prime improvement in between levels of sport is control. Practitioners start controlling the flow of the game the higher the standard gets. At the International echelon, Shreyas Iyer is going to be met with failure a great deal more often than not, If he doesn&#39;t find a way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Abalone-6015"> /u/Ok-Abalone-6015 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wjnar9/shreyas_iyers_tryst_with_the_short_ball/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wjnar9/shreyas_iyers_tryst_with_the_short_ball/">[comments]</a></span>
