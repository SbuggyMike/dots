*Clarence Thomas and Democratic Fecklessness.*
<p>
Just as Republicans (in Congress and on the Supreme Court) have a
tradition of disrespect for democracy and the rights and interests of
the non-rich,
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/democratic-party-clarence-thomas">Democrats have a habit of timidity and weakness</a>
in defending them.
<p>
I have a suspicion that a lot of this timidity and weakness has
been purchased by rich donors that will only support "centrists".
