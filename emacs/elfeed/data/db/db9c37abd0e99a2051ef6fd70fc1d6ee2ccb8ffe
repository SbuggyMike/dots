<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love Beethoven’s symphonies but I’d like to get into the string quartets - any recommendations for getting started please?</p> <p>For reference, I have academic music training and have worked as a classical musician, so I’m quite familiar with lots of things and open to a challenge (I understand that the late quartets are thought of as quite ‘difficult’?) but chamber music in general is a bit of a blind spot for me. </p> <p>Looking forward to your suggestions - pieces and/or recordings.</p> <p>Cheers!</p> <p>Edit: I suppose I mean for context, rather than reference.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JH0190"> /u/JH0190 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13ii5di/beethoven_string_quartets/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13ii5di/beethoven_string_quartets/">[comments]</a></span>
