In the US: call on cable companies to
<a href="https://act.commoncause.org/petitions/tell-cable-providers-no-fox-fee?nowrapper=true&referrer=&source=email-no-fox-fee">stop paying extra to carry Faux
News</a>.
<p>
A previous petition called on cable companies to remove Faux from
their standard list of channels.  I signed that, but it doesn't affect
me personally.  Cable companies use DRM, and monitor what the user
watches.  For those reasons, I refuse to be a cable subscriber.
