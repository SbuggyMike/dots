He says: &quot; My plan was to vary my pace. I knew wickets were slow. And tried to bowl stump to stump. The main thing is that I need to back my strength because in T20s batters try to hit you. So you just focus on bowling good areas and using your strength and your pace. The wickets felt similar to the ones I played in the Caribbean earlier on. The wickets for the one-dayers were similar, and then when I played the last two T20Is, it helped. I am an allrounder - doesn&#39;t matter batting or bowling. The day I bat well, I&#39;ll be a batting allrounder. The day I bowl well, you can call me a bowling allrounder.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Arshdeep Singh is Player of the Series</strong> for his seven wickets at an economy of 6.26. The crowd appreciates this POTS award decision. He says: &quot;It feels really good and feel grateful to represent my country. Tried to keep things simple. As Rahul Dravid sir says we are a processed based teams so I stick with my process. I don&#39;t try to think much about other things during the bowling. The talk is to be adaptable. We have to do whatever the demand of the wicket and the team is. We do what the captain and coaches tell us. Credit to them for the clarity they have given me. I don&#39;t know what my greatest asset is but keeping things simple and focusing on process helps me. The way the captains back the youngsters, and the feel of the dressing room is very nice. Youngsters and seniors feel the same. Helps as a youngster to come in and repeat what you do with your IPL and state teams. My mentor and my competition is my dad, he is very economical and bowling well.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Losing captain Nicholas Pooran:</strong> &quot;We weren&#39;t good enough. India came out aggressive, but as batters we didn&#39;t learn. As bowlers we are getting better, but we need to learn faster. It is a game of skills vs skills and today we weren&#39;t good. We didn&#39;t put partnerships together, except for Hetmyer. When you come against one of the top teams in the world then execution is important. We didn&#39;t come up trumps. As a batting and bowling team we have a lot to do. There&#39;s a lot of cricket to be played, lot of experience to be gained. Hope we learn as a team with these losses. We just won a series, we lost another series here, but we are building towards a World Cup and when we reach there we are ready to compete. (Holder opening the batting) King and Mayers weren&#39;t playing today. We gave him an opportunity today. We know how well he bats. (Invest in spin more?) In hindsight we could&#39;ve played two spinners, something for us to think about. Both Hayden and Akeal are bowling well. Thank you to the fans in America.&quot;</p> <p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=poochi&amp;subject=Bot%20Feedback"><sup>Send feedback</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_schedule"><sup>Schedule</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_help"><sup>Stat Help</sup></a></p> <p><sup>Please don&#39;t post illegal streaming links in match threads</sup></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CricketMatchBot"> /u/CricketMatchBot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wilw3f/post_match_thread_india_vs_west_indies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wilw3f/post_match_thread_india_vs_west_indies/">[comments]</a></span>
