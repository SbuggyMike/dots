<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I would like to ditch Ivy/Counsel for Vertico. There is a package called &quot;helpful&quot; that I had configured like so:</p> <pre><code>(use-package helpful :after counsel :bind ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key) ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command) ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable) ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function) :custom (counsel-describe-function-function #&#39;helpful-callable) (counsel-describe-variable-function #&#39;helpful-variable)) </code></pre> <p>The package was used to improve the default help system by providing more contextual information.</p> <p>I think I need to remove the counsel related lines. Right? However, I&#39;m not sure how to map the keys in that case.</p> <p>The github page for helpful package says:</p> <pre><code>;; Note that the built-in `describe-function&#39; includes both functions ;; and macros. `helpful-function&#39; is functions only, so we provide ;; `helpful-callable&#39; as a drop-in replacement. (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-h f&quot;) #&#39;helpful-callable) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-h v&quot;) #&#39;helpful-variable) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-h k&quot;) #&#39;helpful-key) </code></pre> <p>So that means that I don&#39;t need to use <code>remap describe-variable</code> and <code>remap describe-function</code>?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zoliky"> /u/zoliky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wected/how_to_configure_the_helpful_package_for_using_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wected/how_to_configure_the_helpful_package_for_using_it/">[comments]</a></span>
