<p>As a fun experiment, I use <a href="https://emacstil.com/til/2021/12/28/playing-with-openai/">aide.el</a>  to ask ChatGPT about Emacs productivity tips.</p>

<p><img alt="asking-chatgpt-about-emacs-tips" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2715151/235202162-cc8cb7c5-5153-4335-92d6-b211363c4d26.gif" /></p>

<p>Here’s the text response what I got:</p>

<p>My prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>List five productivity tips and tricks for Emacs power users. Assume these users
can write lisp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GPT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Use org-mode for task management and agenda scheduling, which allows for seamless integration between TODOs, deadlines, and scheduled tasks.</li>
    <li>Utilize keyboard shortcuts for common tasks, such as buffer switching, window splitting, and file saving, to save time and increase efficiency.</li>
    <li>Write custom functions and commands in Emacs Lisp to automate repetitive tasks and workflows, eliminating the need for manual intervention.</li>
    <li>Take advantage of Emacs’s built-in version control and git integration to streamline code development and collaboration.</li>
    <li>Optimize Emacs’s performance by disabling unnecessary modes and packages, using garbage collection strategies to manage memory usage, and limiting the number of open buffers and windows.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>For someone who has been using Emacs for years and <a href="https://junjizhi.com/all/experience/2021/09/03/back-to-emacs/">boomeranging back</a>, these tips are unremarkable. Most of the things I’ve already known,
   like keyboard shortcuts. For example, use Ctrl + n/p to move up/down one
   line, press Ctrl + a/e to beginning or end of line, meta + f/b to move
   forward/backward one word at time, is something I used ALL the time,
   including in terminals. But likely it is worth emphazing for Emacs newbies.</p>

<p>For the mention of things like org-mode, keyboard macros, and Emacs performance tuning, they are commonly seen and asked in places like Reddit or StackOverflow already, so perhaps ChatGPT aggregates the tips based on popularity.</p>

<p>For version control, I would point out <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>, the best git UI for version
   controls. Magit allows you to seamless edit and commit code without leaving
   the editor.</p>

<p>Of course, my prompt is short and not fine tuned at all, so there is room for squeezing more interesting responses from ChatGPT.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think about these ChatGPT tips?</strong></p>
