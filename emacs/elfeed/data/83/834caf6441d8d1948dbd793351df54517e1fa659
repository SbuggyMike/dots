<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I like i3, but also like cinnamon and switch to it from time to time. Recently I&#39;ve been feeling it&#39;s time to switch to Wayland. It&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve tried to switch to Wayland, but every time I encounter some difficulties. I have only one laptop I use Linux 100% of my time, whether for work or personal matters. It means that I use a lot of different apps for a variety of needs, and sometimes some of them work strangely, for example, scaling, screen sharing, fonts rendering, or gaming.</p> <p>Please tell me, am I the only one such dumb and can&#39;t switch completely, or is there really still quite a lot of problems? Could you share your experience?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ipa8"> /u/ipa8 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138zod9/do_we_finally_switch_to_wayland_or_not/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138zod9/do_we_finally_switch_to_wayland_or_not/">[comments]</a></span>
