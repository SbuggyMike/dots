<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a package in the AUR i use regularly that&#39;s about 3 months out of date. I left a comment about 3 months ago with some simple package changes that would greatly improve the package.</p> <p>I left a second comment six weeks or so ago offering to take care of my proposed change and the update if the maintainer would add me as a maintainer. I&#39;ve had no response to either comment. Current maintainer has not logged in to the AUR since march.</p> <p>At this point, is it reasonable for me to submit an orphan request and take over the package? Or is there another step i should take first?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lykwydchykyn"> /u/lykwydchykyn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w38qm3/aur_etiquette/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w38qm3/aur_etiquette/">[comments]</a></span>
