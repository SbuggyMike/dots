A Republican who pushed to override the 2020 election results
now proposes a strategy to rig the 2024 election: make it
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/gop-lawyer-2024-college-voting">harder
for college students to vote</a>.

Republicans are already trying hard to do this, and
facing a lot of resistance.  What the presentation shows
is that Republican activists feel no shame whatsoever
about systematic cheating.
