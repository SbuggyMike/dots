<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After switching to Firefox several months ago I found out that it does everything Chrome does almost as well, in some areas it&#39;s even better. The only thing that was holding me back is the saved passwords, but i changed all the important ones and started keeping them in a password manager, so it won&#39;t be a problem anymore. What holds you back from switching to Firefox? What features should Firefox add or change in order to become a better alternative for you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/1Blue3Brown"> /u/1Blue3Brown </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w15cze/what_makes_you_use_chrome_instead_of_firefox/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w15cze/what_makes_you_use_chrome_instead_of_firefox/">[comments]</a></span>
