The UAE has convicted democracy campaigner Asim Ghafoor, who is a US
citizen, of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/16/politics/khashoggi-lawyer-detained/index.html">money laundering</a> after a suspect trial.
<p>
He was arrested in a flight connection in Abu Dhabi.  I recommend people
<a href="https://stallman.org/stay-away-countries.html#uae">avoid setting foot in Abu Dhabi's airport</a>.
<p>
Another bizarre thing in this report is that it the accusation appears
to have come initially from the US; but the US did not arrested him,
instead it let him fly to Abu Dhabi airport and he was arrested there.
<p>
I suspect this represents dirty work.
<p>
The US has a pattern, since 2001, of persecuting Muslims that <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2016-jul-oct.html#30_October_2016_(Fair_trial)">raise
money in the US for charity in other countries</a>.
Try as they might,
they get accused of terrorism, or violating financial regulations.
Is that what happened here?
