Biden <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/07/14/biden-says-he-would-go-war-iran-last-resort">threatened to attack Iran</a> to prevent its developing nuclear weapons.
<p>
As the article says, "It makes absolutely zero sense that he won't
delist the IRGC [revolutionary guards] to prevent an Iranian nuke but
would launch a war to prevent an Iranian nuke."  In addition, such an
attack is much harder than it sounds.  The crucial facilities are
underground and Iran has years of experience resisting Israel's
attacks.

Threatening Iran is also likely to drive it into a closer alliance
with Putin.  How foolish.
