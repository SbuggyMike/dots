<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, </p> <p>In last years US Open round 1, I was 118 Elo and defeated my 1750 opponent. My rating was from when I played as an 8 year old, so I had to start from that when I got back into tournaments last summer as a 20 year old. My friend recently suggested it could&#39;ve been the largest upset in USCF history. I&#39;m not sure if I believe it because there&#39;s probably been a 100 who beat a 2000+ at some point. But I was wondering if there&#39;s any database I could check to see? It would be cool to be able to claim the largest USCF upset lol. I will be back at the US Open next week, but now I have a 1550 rating.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sms42069"> /u/sms42069 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wc6oeo/biggest_upset_in_modern_uscf_history/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wc6oeo/biggest_upset_in_modern_uscf_history/">[comments]</a></span>
