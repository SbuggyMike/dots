<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been recently spending a lot of time inside docker containers (or Podman in my case), and because of this, <code>project.el</code> has picked up a project and stored it in the projects file. If Emacs reboots and the container is no longer there, project attempts to open the file in TRAMP, and TRAMP hangs until I press <code>q</code> to allow tramp to exit.</p> <p>I can think of two ways to hypothetically fix this:</p> <p>The first is by modifying the <code>project-find-functions</code> list. It&#39;s a list of functions which are ran in succession until one of them returns a truthy value. My current <code>project-find-functions</code> is <code>(project-try-vc project-try-local)</code>. I believe in my case <code>project-try-vc</code> is returning <code>t</code>.</p> <p>The second is by telling TRAMP to move on after a failure, allowing the boot to complete even when some projects are not accessible. I&#39;m thinking an advice might be necessary to achieve this.</p> <p>Are there any other options? Does anyone out there have a solution to this already?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FederalPirate2867"> /u/FederalPirate2867 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/131s1ov/avoiding_the_loading_of_tramp_projects_at_startup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/131s1ov/avoiding_the_loading_of_tramp_projects_at_startup/">[comments]</a></span>
