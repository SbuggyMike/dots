The sound of Geo To Aisey playing for the umpteenth time quietly rings out from the TV speakers to the grainy visuals of Pakistan’s 2009 World Cup win. It is the golden age of Geo Super, and the domestic season is in full swing. For me, this meant waking up at 6 AM and running downstairs, trying to get the (probably illegal) stream to work and to not awaken my parents. All this to watch my first cricket love, the National T20 Cup. At eight years old, I wasn’t very fussed about the glorious 360p broadcast quality nor the same ads on loop. I was just beyond ecstatic to wake up every day and see my heroes play.</p> <p>The National T20 cup then is not how we know it today. It featured two unique tournaments. The first being the National T20 cup itself and the second being the Super 8. The former was our domestic T20 tournament while the latter was the precursor to the PSL. Starting with the National T20 Cup, it had its inaugural season in 2004 and featured city-based teams from all around Pakistan. It is rather unique, to my knowledge, as far as domestic level T20 competitions go because it was technically an international tournament. The Afghan national team would send its side in the form of the Afghan Cheetas due to a lack of infrastructure at home. All of these teams would combine for a few weeks of rather high-quality domestic cricket. </p> <p>The Super 8 was a smaller tournament that comprised the top 8 domestic teams in the country. It was a high-quality tournament that ran for a shorter time, featuring all the best names in Pakistan. The super eight debuted in 2011 and would be replaced by the Pakistan Super League in 2016. Now that we established what exactly these two tournaments were, let’s discuss what exactly made them so great.</p> <pre><code> The Teams </code></pre> <p>The National T20 Cup today features 6 teams: Sindh, Balochistan, Southern Punjab, Central Punjab, KPK, and Northern Areas. Although I do like this because it creates one team from each province with high competition for a spot, there was something almost carnivalesque about the 18 teams which competed at the peak of the tournament. The number of teams would usually fluctuate between 11 and 14 with the mainstays being: The Karachi Dolphins, Karachi Zebras, Lahore Lions, Lahore Eagles, Rawalpindi Rams, Sialkot Stallions, Quetta Bears, Islamabad Leopards, Faisalabad Wolves, Quetta Bears, Abbottabad Falcons, Peshawar Panthers, and Hyderabad Hawks. Every major city, at some point or another, had a team comprised of mostly local players to cheer on. The names were lacking in creativity (save for the Dera Ibexes) but that wasn’t really a stifling issue. Big cities like Karachi and Lahore had two teams to fit more players, but I’ve never met a Zebras or Eagles fan so it’s safe to say that the Karachi Dolphins and the Lahore Lions were the faces of the two cities.</p> <pre><code> The Players </code></pre> <p>This league was quality. The PCB would habitually refuse NOCs for their players to participate in other leagues just to make sure that the best of the best were participating. To list some of the talent each team had at the same time </p> <p>Karachi Dolphins: Shahid Afridi, Mohammad Shami, Fawad Alam, Sarfraz Ahmed, and Asad Shafiq</p> <p>Lahore Lions: Umar Akmal, Kamran Akmal, Wahab Riaz, Aziz Cheema, and Imran Farhat</p> <p>Faisalabad Wolves: Misbah ul Haq, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, and Asif Ali</p> <p>Rawalpindi Rams: Sohail Tanvir, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Amir, and Yasir Arafat</p> <p>Sialkot Stallions: Shoaib Malik, Abdur Rehman, Naved ul Hasan, Imran Nazir, and Haris Sohail</p> <p>Peshawar Panthers: Umar Gul, Younis Khan, Mohammad Rizwan, and Adil Amin</p> <p>Afghan Cheetas: Gulbadin Naib, Mohammad Nabi, Najibullah Zadran, and Hamid Hassan</p> <p>Islamabad Leopards: Shoaib Akthar, Imad Wasim, Babar Azam, and Shan Masood</p> <p>You get the point, each team had multiple international capped players of high prestige, I even remember seeing the big boys stroll out in their Pakistan helmets rather than their team helmets. Seeing a bloke in a green lid score big in this tournament would always bring 8-year-old me joy. For the high number of teams playing the talent was spread very well and every game seemed a toss-up. When we went to the super 8 tournament the quality of the event got that much higher as only the top teams were invited to participate. This super eight tournament immediately proved a success as Rawalpindi won the very first edition via a super over in the final. In fact, the Lahore Lions had even bested the Mumbai Indians during their meeting in the Champions League. This was without a doubt among the most quality domestic comps at it&#39;s peak. </p> <pre><code> The Kits </code></pre> <p>Short section here but those kits were sexy in my humble opinion. Loads better than some of the PSL kits we have today. </p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/venyk10r3td91.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a22eae0d41e99b814bb21cc464cd4e26bc23922">Lahore Lions</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/pwxah76w3td91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a72e7c6565e8d45c5697d3a4b698df4ea09a6640">Karachi Dolphins featuring Lala and the aforementioned green lid</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/hhy7ijty3td91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74d94813c8d7fb3c4dbcfc98799fed75e081aee3">Faisalabad Wolves which are probably my favourite</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/mcnlnef24td91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a361b63c646521b2c03bcba2c7dc04bd868cc3b8">Shoaib Malik and his Sialkot Stallions u/HiImSuperman101</a></p> <pre><code> The Broadcast </code></pre> <p>The good old days of Geo Super. Every match would receive an almost international quality level of broadcast. They would show player fact sheets during some ad breaks, some pretty slick animations for the time, as well as the token phrase which I still remember “Yeh hai cricket Pakistan” (TL: This is Pakistan Cricket). They took care to make sure the games were watchable and enjoyable. It was leagues above modern T20 Blast broadcasting (not the SKY games the county streamed games). It was of genuine franchise league quality despite Pakistan not having a proper franchise league yet. </p> <pre><code> Conclusion </code></pre> <p>Maybe it&#39;s just personal nostalgia, the reminiscence upon simpler times. Regardless of what it was that enchanted me about this tournament as a kid, I still stand by the quality and fun this league gave to me and millions of others. This wasn&#39;t a run-of-the-mill single-camera broadcast domestic trophy, rather, this tournament had an image and pumping heart of its own which made every edition of it a joy to follow.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ghostly_100"> /u/Ghostly_100 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w88fl6/my_first_cricketing_love_the_national_t20_cup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/w88fl6/my_first_cricketing_love_the_national_t20_cup/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
