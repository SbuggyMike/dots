Starmer has dropped the policy commitments he made when he ran for leadership
of the Labour Party, and it seems he was
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/03/labour-tuition-fees-keir-starmer-political-party-british-democratic-history">planning all along to do so</a>.
  Apparently, all Labour stands for with him in charge is winning power.
<p>
Most horribly, he has made sure that all <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2023-jan-apr.html#4_March_2023_(Ideal_candidate_blocked,_UK)">new Labour MPs will be like him</a>.
<p>
  It's like the British equivalent of the <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2018-mar-jun.html#6_May_2018_(US:_progressive_candidates_pressured_to_drop_out)">"centrist" US Democrats</a>,
  but worse.  Imagine if the Democratic Party machinery had the
official power to forbid progressive candidates from running
in a primary.  That's what Labour is now.
