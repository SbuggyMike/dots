<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Between fuel, food and all the related price increases, it seems like life is going to be unaffordable. People are talking about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/uk-energy-bills-are-set-to-top-500-per-month-as-russia-cuts-gas">£500 energy bills</a>, fertilizer prices have <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/GB-fertiliser-prices">gone up 150%</a> - this is going to hit food prices more and more. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/14/private-rents-britain-rose-record-rate-past-year-swansea-manchester-london">Rent is rising too</a>. </p> <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/percentile-points-from-1-to-99-for-total-income-before-and-after-tax">Half of brits earn under £23,500</a>, median household income is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-for-financial-years-ending-1995-to-2021/households-below-average-income-an-analysis-of-the-income-distribution-fye-1995-to-fye-2021">£539 a week</a> - I don&#39;t see how many of those people will be able to make ends meet. On top of this, it seems like the US is going into recession already - how far behind will we be?</p> <p>What will happen to all the people that can&#39;t pay their rent, or buy food? </p> <p>I guess options range between</p> <ul> <li>The government will step in and put price caps on / put huge welfare checks in people&#39;s pockets. (Will they enforce rent freezes? How will they stop food prices increasing? - This seems unlikely) and</li> <li>People unable to pay will become homeless en masse. Riots + bedlam ensue.</li> </ul> <p>Is my analysis close to being right? If so, shouldn&#39;t we be much more worried than we are? It seems like we are falling into this in slow motion with no one running the country and the candidates for PM barely acknowledging this. </p> <p>What is going on?!</p> <hr/> <p>Edit - for fun I did <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RSwZJUN.png">a little analysis</a> - holding average salary and taking that fuel price as the max it will get to, how much do rent, water bills and food need to go up before life is unaffordable for the average household - answer is 29%. I guess we are at 12% inflation over the last 12 months, so hopefully the average person is ok. It&#39;s going to be a lot worse for people on lower percentiles though.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pretzel"> /u/pretzel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/wb36jx/how_bad_is_this_winter_going_to_be/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/wb36jx/how_bad_is_this_winter_going_to_be/">[comments]</a></span>
