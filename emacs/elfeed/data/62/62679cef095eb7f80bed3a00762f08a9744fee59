<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What the title basically says. I understand the need for solidarity for Ukraine, but the Israel-Palestine issue is far more complex than the Russian invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>Anyways, am I missing something in regards to the chess community vis-a-vis Israel? It seems ridiculously offensive to the very real victims of the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and it&#39;s strange that it&#39;s right in the middle of a freaking chess subreddit without any explanation.</p> <p>From a chess-wise perspective, it makes no sense: both Israel and Palestine are being represented in the Olympiad this year. While I can understand that several Ukrainian and Russian chess players have been in immense danger due to Putin, it is disingenuous and untrue to act as if the average Israeli chess player is in equal danger as a Palestinian one for obvious reasons.</p> <p>There should be a detailed explanation as to why this decision was taken by the mods. And to preemptively point out something: criticism of Israel isn&#39;t anti-Semitism or hate speech, and I believe in a two state solution myself (not that it is relevant).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NefariousnessShort36"> /u/NefariousnessShort36 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/weylew/why_is_the_israeli_flag_on_the_banner/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/weylew/why_is_the_israeli_flag_on_the_banner/">[comments]</a></span>
