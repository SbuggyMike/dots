<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I compile an <code>el</code> file, I sometimes don&#39;t see all the possible &quot;undefined&quot; warnings because they depend on the currently loaded packages in my emacs session. For example, if the file depends on the package <code>org</code>, some warnings would not show if <code>org</code> was loaded when I opened an org file before or if <code>org</code> is loaded by default in my init file.</p> <p>How do I make sure that compilation always happens in a &quot;clean environment&quot; where no packages are loaded? Running with <code>emacs -Q</code> would not work since custom packages can never be loaded, for example with <code>eval-when-compile</code> (unless I set up the <code>load-path</code> which is difficult since it is set by <code>straight</code> in my case).</p> <p>Also, would the compilation result be the same whether these required packages (like <code>org</code> in my example) are loaded or not? In other words, is it safe to ignore these warnings?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tohiko"> /u/Tohiko </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w6a7ev/compiling_el_files_in_a_clean_environment/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w6a7ev/compiling_el_files_in_a_clean_environment/">[comments]</a></span>
