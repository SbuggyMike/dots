<p>The other day I wrote about Álvaro Ramírez’s <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10653">DWIM Shell Commands package</a>. The TL;DR is that it’s a template framework for executing shell commands from within Emacs when the shell command has tricky syntax or hard to remember options.</p>
<p>Since writing the package, Ramírez has been revisiting some of his custom Elisp functions that call shell commands and refactoring them to use his new package. The first example is <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited/">password protecting one or more PDFs</a>. This example is noteworthy for how much shorter it is using the framework than it was originally. As Ramírez says, the fact that it’s so short and easy to write a custom function for invoking a shell utility means that he’ll do it more often and therefore streamline his workflow.</p>
<p>The second example involves <a href="https://xenodium.com/png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/">converting a png file to a series of icns files</a>. This example is distinguished by the fact that it’s more like a script than a single invocation of some utility.</p>
<p>You could, of course, do all this with a shell script or some custom Elisp but using the DWIM-shell-command package makes it easy because it does a lot of the work for you. If you find yourself invoking utilities via the shell command from Emacs, you should definitely take a look at Ramírez’s package.</p>
