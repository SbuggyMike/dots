<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using startx to launch my window manager. Inside .xinitrc I&#39;ve got <code>xset r rate 200 50</code> to speed up my keyboard input. The keyboard connects with my computer via bluetooth. However, when I&#39;m afk for a while the keyboard switches to sleep state and disconnects from my computer. When it reconnects the <code>xset r rate</code> and <code>xsetkbmap</code> instructions no longer apply for my keyboard, and I&#39;ve got to manually run them again. I did tinker with udev rules for hours with no success.</p> <p>Is there a way to run a script when a specific bluetooth device connects?\ Could I please have some pointers or an example?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hjklplayer"> /u/hjklplayer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wf55ir/run_script_when_bluetooth_device_connects/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wf55ir/run_script_when_bluetooth_device_connects/">[comments]</a></span>
