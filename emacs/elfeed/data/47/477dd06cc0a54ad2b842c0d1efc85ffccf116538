<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My 8 yo has recently started to express an interest in chess to my delight.</p> <p>However, I have almost no background in chess, and just know how pieces move. I&#39;ve never studied openings. I recently signed up on lichess and chess.com, and tried a few tactics puzzles (mate in 1, etc).</p> <p>Are there any apps, videos, podcasts, etc you would recommend that I can easily download on my phone before my flight?</p> <p>I want to wait on buying books/ebooks until I get home since I don&#39;t have my kindle with me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SituationNo3"> /u/SituationNo3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbsxg5/will_be_on_a_10_hour_flight_soon_and_want_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wbsxg5/will_be_on_a_10_hour_flight_soon_and_want_to/">[comments]</a></span>
