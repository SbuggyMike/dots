<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there, as the title indicates, I&#39;m looking for good alternatives for Irfan View. Features I&#39;d love to have: - paste an image from clipboard (e.g. after taking a screenshot) - simple selecting and cutting as in Irfan View - batch converting / renaming based on EXIF data - the application should be more or less as lightweight as Irfan View is. GIMP is a very nice piece of software but a bit too heavy for doing this simple tasks quickly. </p> <p>I&#39;m currently running GNOME and as far as I&#39;ve noticed, eye of gnome isn&#39;t capable of any of this features.</p> <p>Thank you very much and have a good day :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bienenvolk"> /u/Bienenvolk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w2pl31/irfan_view_alternatives/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w2pl31/irfan_view_alternatives/">[comments]</a></span>
