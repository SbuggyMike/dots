<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m facing an issue where I can&#39;t log in to a newly created user account on my Arch Linux system. Here are the steps I took to create the user account:</p> <ol> <li>Logged in as root</li> <li>Ran the command useradd [username]to create the user account</li> <li>Ran the command passwd [username]to set a password for the user account</li> </ol> <p>However, when I try to log in to the user account using the graphical login manager, the screen goes black and shows the processes it executes, after entering the password and then returns me to the login screen. I&#39;m certain that I&#39;m entering the correct username and password and that the keyboard layout is set correctly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maybe_goose"> /u/maybe_goose </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138zz6l/cant_log_in_to_newly_created_user_account/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/138zz6l/cant_log_in_to_newly_created_user_account/">[comments]</a></span>
