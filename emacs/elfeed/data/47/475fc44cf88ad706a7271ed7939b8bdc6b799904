Many blind internauts say that nonfree website enhancers make web
sites harder to use, 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/technology/ai-web-accessibility.html">not easier.</a>
<p>
If you judge by convenience alone, you might think it is unfortunate
that these proprietary website enhancers don't work well.  But what if
they did?  Freedom-disrespecting web sites would benefit from them,
while web sites in the Free World would be obliged to reject them.
<p>
In addition, I suspect these enhancers trample the visitors' freedom
by sending nonfree JavaScript code that users are compelled to run.
If so, then were they fixed to work well, they would give visitors
convenience in exchange for their freedom.
