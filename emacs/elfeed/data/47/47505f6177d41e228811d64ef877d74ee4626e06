<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just wanted to hear from your experiences about this topic. I have a Thinkpad X201, which is 11 year old. Recently I started using Sway on Wayland but it feels kinda slow comparing to i3 on Xorg. Haven&#39;t done any benchmarks though. But if you have similar experiences I&#39;d like to hear.</p> <p>Edit: Found the problem(s). SDDM was weirdly hanging out apparently, removing the theming fixed slow start. Also my CPU didn&#39;t run on performance mod (have no idea why), changing that also fixed programs starting slow.</p> <p>Thanks for all the replies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/muhyb"> /u/muhyb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wjlvxe/how_wayland_performs_on_old_machines/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wjlvxe/how_wayland_performs_on_old_machines/">[comments]</a></span>
