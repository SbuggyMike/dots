<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>How do I use embark-live on the exported results of a vertico grep search?</p> <p>I would like to collect/export the results of the search (acting as a snapshot of my search state), and I would also like the embark export buffer to update. E.g. if I select a search result and change it so it no longer matches the search, it should no longer show in the buffer.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Each time I&#39;ve tried to use embark-act -&gt; embark-live; the focus stays in the vertico search. I&#39;ve fumbled and tried a few things to dismiss the search and work with the embark-live buffer but can&#39;t seem to figure that out.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Any tips for what I&#39;m doing wrong? (Does embark support this workflow?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlucky_Business1099"> /u/Unlucky_Business1099 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wjkqca/embark_live_updating_search_results/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wjkqca/embark_live_updating_search_results/">[comments]</a></span>
