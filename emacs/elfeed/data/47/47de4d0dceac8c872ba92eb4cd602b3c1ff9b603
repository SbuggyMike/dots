<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Suppose I have booted into a lightweight distro like alpine. Then is it possible to use alpine as a bootloader, to boot into an operating system with a different kernel, say freebsd or fedora. If this is possible, why aren&#39;t&#39; core linux, freedos, or alpine used as bootloaders with more advanced functionality? It would be great if my bootloader could edit files and run scripts to fix broken installs. The bootloader distro could only contain the kernel and busybox. I know I can use dual boot and/or livecd for this but why not?</p> <p>Edit: This could also replace usb sticks for installation as you could just wget an iso and boot from it directly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DitherTheWither"> /u/DitherTheWither </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wibsp3/can_you_chainload_after_the_kernel_has_started/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wibsp3/can_you_chainload_after_the_kernel_has_started/">[comments]</a></span>
