<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all!</p> <p>So, around 3 months ago I upgraded to emacs 29 and set up a &quot;fresh&quot; init.el; lots of copy/paste from my old config with an eye to using less &quot;custom&quot; features/keybindings and using &quot;modern&quot; tooling like <code>embark</code> and <code>consult</code>. I mostly develop in Elixir, so configured <code>lsp</code> with <code>elixir-mode</code> and found that <code>xref-find-definitions</code> triggered from the <code>embark</code> menu was working great and a real time saver.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, <code>xref-find-definitions</code> stopped working. I don&#39;t <em>think</em> I changed anything in my init.el, at least not related to lsp-mode or elixir-mode and definitely nothing related to xref. Now I always get <code>No definitions found</code> in the minibuffer whenever I call <code>xref-find-definitions</code> (either via <code>C-. RET</code> or <code>M-.</code>) even for items I <em>know</em> worked a few weeks ago. I&#39;ve switched to using <code>dump-jump</code> in the meantime which is a great package but isn&#39;t as well integrated into <code>embark</code>.</p> <p>Can anyone point me in the right direction for diagnosing this issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hairlesscaveman"> /u/hairlesscaveman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w8dpno/xreffinddefinitions_stopped_working_how_can_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w8dpno/xreffinddefinitions_stopped_working_how_can_i/">[comments]</a></span>
