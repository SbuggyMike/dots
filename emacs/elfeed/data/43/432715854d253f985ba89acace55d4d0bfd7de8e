<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Arch wiki is letting me down: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Multiboot_USB_drive">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Multiboot_USB_drive</a></p> <p>I want to create a USB thumb drive with a bunch of iso images for different distros (Arch, Debian, SystemRescue, OMV, Proxmox, OpenWrt, etc) that I can boot on EFI machines. If it can also boot on BIOS machines, great, but EFI is a hard requirement. I want the boot process, after I select which ISO I want, to be like I booted directly from the ISO.</p> <p>The warnings in the wiki for the GRUB loopback method (e.g., incompatible ISOs no boot menu) seem like a non started. The syslinux method seems promising, but might only be applicable for BIOS systems. I tried it nevertheless and failed. The steps in the wiki are sparse, so I may have screwed something up.</p> <p>Of the automated tools listed on the wiki only liveusb-builder seems promising (the others are not in the AUR, dead, or seem sketchy). I am hesitant to install a tool for a task that seems like I can do it manually.</p> <p>Is it possible to create what I want from the CLI?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AppointmentNearby161"> /u/AppointmentNearby161 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13j5tr1/multiboot_usb_drive_for_iso_images/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13j5tr1/multiboot_usb_drive_for_iso_images/">[comments]</a></span>
