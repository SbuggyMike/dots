<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everybody!</p> <p>I just read an opinion by a group of friends that John Williams doesn&#39;t have any truly original pieces of his own and that all film compositions are influenced by other scores.</p> <p>While this is mostly true (for example, Vader theme song is heavily influenced by Gustav Holst&#39;s &quot;Mars&quot;), I don&#39;t know if I could agree with it.</p> <p>Having greater experience than me (I just love the music and getting immersed in it), what is your expert opinion?</p> <p>TIA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kiceres"> /u/Kiceres </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/130q4na/john_williams/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/130q4na/john_williams/">[comments]</a></span>
