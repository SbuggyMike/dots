<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I made <a href="https://mw9k.github.io/magnum/">my first website</a>, to estimate your chess.com &#39;Magnus Number&#39;...</p> <p><a href="https://mw9k.github.io/magnum/">https://mw9k.github.io/magnum/</a></p> <p>Enter a username &amp; choose a time control, then it will attempt to find a path of victories by which that user &quot;defeated&quot; Magnus Carlsen’s main account.</p> <p><em>(To explain it another way: you beat someone who beat someone... who beat Magnus Carlsen.)</em></p> <h1>🚨 Performance Disclaimer: 🚨</h1> <p>The search algorithm at present is far from optimal. It is prone to wandering and sometimes will take illogical backwards steps. I plan to improve that in an update soon. <strong>For now: it won&#39;t necessarily find the shortest path or your best Magnus Number</strong>. (Thanks for checking it out anyway🙏)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BigGuyForYou_"> /u/BigGuyForYou_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/whj0o5/i_made_a_website_to_find_your_chesscom_magnus/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/whj0o5/i_made_a_website_to_find_your_chesscom_magnus/">[comments]</a></span>
