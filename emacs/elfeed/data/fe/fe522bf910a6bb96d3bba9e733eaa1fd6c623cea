<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>months ago I have installed arch on my previous laptop&#39;s ssd and have been using it in an ssd enclosure as an external ssd alongside my laptop which has Windows in its internal ssd. Because my laptop happens to have two ssd slots (one of which is unoccupied) I wanted to take the arch ssd out of the enclosure and into my laptops second ssd slot. My expectation is to use both windows and arch in a dual-boot manner but without the disadvantages of dual-boot (two seperate ssd&#39;s: lesser chance of things going wrong, not tight on space, etc.). </p> <p>Yesterday I have opened up my laptop for the first time and installed the arch ssd into the empty slot and put the laptop back together. When I start the laptop, I can choose between arch and windows but when I boot arch, the following error occurs: </p> <p>&quot;ERROR: device ‘UUID=&lt;device\_uuid&gt;’ not found. Skipping fsck&quot;</p> <p>I know that this error is occuring because the UUID is different now that it is in an ssd slot instead of being connected by USB. So, naturally I have to somehow edit the UUID that the OS searches for when booting. But I just couldn&#39;t figure out how to and was unsuccessful with finding similar cases in the internet forums. </p> <p>As a result, I&#39;m here, asking for your help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Free_Transition_4746"> /u/Free_Transition_4746 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w80n6t/ssd_with_arch_installation_that_was_once/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w80n6t/ssd_with_arch_installation_that_was_once/">[comments]</a></span>
