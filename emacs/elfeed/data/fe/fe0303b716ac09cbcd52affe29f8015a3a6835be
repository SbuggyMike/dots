I appreciate reporting broken links in stallman.org.  To make the
reports useful, please send each broken link in a separate email.  The
email should contain

<ol type="1">
  <li>The full name of the page which contains the broken link.</li>
  <li>The URL that the broken link tries to link to.</li>
  <li>Around 8 lines of text which contains the broken link.</li>
</ol>
Please send that email to me, and I will forward it to the team.
<p>
Please don't send more than 4 per day!  I can easily get overloaded
and have a backlog.
<p>
Thanks.
