US cities are raising the priority of efforts to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/weather/deadly-heat-waves-chief-heat-officers-climate/index.html">adapt to extreme heat</a>,
since heat we now call "extreme" will become normal</a>.

Most of China has been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/china/china-summer-extreme-weather-climate-change-intl-hnk-mic/index.html">hit badly</a> by extreme heat and extreme rain.

Will Americans and Chinese recognize that current policies will make this
much worse in a decade or two?  Mere adaptation to a danger while we continue
to make it a little worse every year is not rational, and in the long term
the heat will win the race.
