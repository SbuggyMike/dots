<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m relatively new to competitive chess, and I&#39;ve been told by a few coaches that I am a tactical player. I knew this, but I just didn&#39;t think it was so apparent. I ask this question because I switched to 1. d4 recently in an effort to play the Catalan/GQ/Trompowsky lines, and I&#39;ve been less than pleased playing them. I rarely feel like I get the pressure that I want in each opening. Prior to this, I played 1. e4, preferring lesser seen aggressive lines (Vienna/Grand Prix/Orthoschnapp or Schlecter/Fantasy or Tal or Panov). I am now considering switching back to 1. e4 and playing funky stuff. </p> <p>The thing is, I started playing 1. d4 because I wanted to learn to play a bit more positionally, but the results just aren&#39;t there, and the game just seems like its very easy for my opponent to play and get a decent position. </p> <p>So I&#39;m wondering what y&#39;all do.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dubtee1500"> /u/Dubtee1500 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jjzf1/do_you_tailor_your_opening_repertoire_to_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13jjzf1/do_you_tailor_your_opening_repertoire_to_your/">[comments]</a></span>
