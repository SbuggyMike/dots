<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good morning everyone and happy...Wednesday? Sorry about the delay for this week, only excuse is I&#39;ve been sick over the past week and have been procrastinating a lot of responsibilities. Hopefully you had a chance to listen to last week&#39;s featured work, Monteverdi&#39;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w30yof/potw_30_monteverdi_hor_chel_ciel_e_la_terra/">&quot;Hor che&#39;l ciel e la terra&quot;</a> from Madrigals book 8. </p> <p>Our Piece of the Week is actually a set of pieces; <strong>Max Reger&#39;s 6 Intermezzi for piano, op.45 (1900)</strong></p> <p><strong><a href="http://vmirror.imslp.org/files/imglnks/usimg/b/b5/IMSLP43077-PMLP06749-Reger_op.045_Sechs_Intermezzi_RGA.pdf">score from IMSLP</a></strong></p> <p>some listening notes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgVelesx1Qs">olla-vogala</a></p> <blockquote> <p>The appearance of Sechs Intermezzi, Op. 45, composed in 1900 ushers in the beginning of Reger’s middle period of creativity. In these pieces, Reger seems to have taken the virtuosic qualities of his early period works to the limit. Because these pieces should be viewed as a transition between his early and middle periods, the harmonies employed are in principle, not radically different than the ones he had used before. Similar to the Op. 32 pieces, there is an even more liberal use of chromatic harmonies.</p> <p>You can hear echos of Bach, Schumann, Liszt, and Brahms. This is the kind of late romantic piano music you never hear because few pianists have the requisite technique, suppleness, and patience to learn Reger and because it was written at the turn of the century when traditional compositional styles à la Brahms weren&#39;t fashionable (Dohnanyi, Taneyev, and many other late romantics suffer the same obscurity). Reger&#39;s skill as an organist reveals itself in the bass lines, massive chords, double notes and stretchy legato lines-as if he&#39;s constantly trying to make the piano sound like its bigger sister.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ways to Listen</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgVelesx1Qs">YouTube - Markus Beker</a>, includes score</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=976-C03FvE8">YouTube - John Buttrick</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5r6M4jUOoI">YouTUbe - Wigbert Traxler</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4GZVAFQzg5pMeEtE3ryFIG?si=P2kZ_lKgQrmOAxyaI7yx0Q">Spotify - Joseph Moog</a></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Discussion Prompts</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>What are your favorite parts or moments in this work?
