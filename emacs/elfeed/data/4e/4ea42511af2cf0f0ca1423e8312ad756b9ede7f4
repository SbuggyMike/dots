<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Long text, skip to TL;DR if you don&#39;t care about my bullshit.</p> <p>I&#39;m pretty accostumed to terminal and cli apps, but I love KDE and switch back and forth between Sway and KDE (before wayland it was bspwm), but I don&#39;t stay at KDE too long.</p> <p>I feel more &quot;productive&quot; because I use the keyboard all the time and most shortcuts from the apps I use are similar to Vim (hjkl, ctrl+d, ctrl+u, etc).</p> <p>And my PC is a laptop, so touchpad is terrible, but now my laptop will be stationary since I don&#39;t need to travel for work anymore so I have full access to an external mouse and keyboard all the time.</p> <p>I&#39;ll write some workflow example:</p> <p>I use CMUS for music and <a href="https://github.com/jarun/nnn">nnn</a> for file management.</p> <ul> <li><p>I just downloaded a new album. It is in my downloads folder.</p></li> <li><p>Right now on my screen I have the terminal with cmus.</p></li> <li><p>I hit Windows + E and it opens a terminal with nnn.</p></li> <li><p>I use hjkl to navigate to downloads folder. The new album folder has a terrible name, like artist_album_mp3_320kbps.</p></li> <li><p>I hit &quot;r&quot; in nnn and it opens my text editor right there in the same terminal with all files and folder names, i can edit the folder name in the text editor (helix in my case, but it can be vim, nano, kakoune) and save it.</p></li> <li><p>Now I&#39;m back at nnn. I press space to select the folder i just renamed</p></li> <li><p>I navigate to the music folder (which for me is a shortcut away in nnn, i just hit &quot;,m&quot;) and press &quot;v&quot; to move the folder to the current music folder i&#39;m at.</p></li> <li><p>Now I go to cmus terminal hitting Windows+J or L (if it&#39;s left or right from nnn)</p></li> <li><p>Press ctrl+A (it adds all albums from my music folder) and the new album is right there.</p></li> <li><p>I browse using hjkl like always and play it.</p></li> </ul> <p>All this time I&#39;m with my hands on the keyboard home row. It takes me 20 seconds to achieve.</p> <p>I feel it&#39;s faster because i don&#39;t take my hand alway from the keyboard, but if you think about it, it&#39;s <strong>not THAT MUCH faster</strong> than doing it the regular way.</p> <ul> <li>The download is complete.</li> <li>I open dolphin, click &quot;Downloads&quot; in the left panel</li> <li>click the downloaded folder, hit F2 and rename it</li> <li>hit ctrl-x to cut, click the Music folder in the left panel, ctrl-v to paste it</li> <li>Open the music player, hit refresh to update the music library and done</li> </ul> <p>It will probably take the same time or if much, 5 seconds more.</p> <p>The thing is, it always feels clunky to me. It is mildly frustrating having to juggle keyboard and mouse and hitting shortcuts that are key combos.</p> <p>But I love KDE&#39;s notification center, Krunner and all the integration that comes with it.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p> <p>Long time tiling WM and terminal app users who switched to KDE and stayed: Did you have to change a lot of KDE&#39;s default behaviour or install &quot;plugins&quot;? How it feels now after some time? What was your experience switching?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_culito_"> /u/_culito_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vznfn4/hardcore_tiling_wm_and_terminal_users_that/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/vznfn4/hardcore_tiling_wm_and_terminal_users_that/">[comments]</a></span>
