<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am working with Ansible and want to see diffs in the ansible-vaults. The guide [here](<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29937195/how-to-diff-ansible-vault-changes">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29937195/how-to-diff-ansible-vault-changes</a>) </p> <p>It is basically just to add your vault files to <code>.gitattributes</code> with something like <code>/**/vault.yml diff=ansible-vault merge=binary</code> and changing git settings with <code>git config --global diff.ansible-vault.textconv &quot;ansible-vault view</code>. This works perfectly in the terminal, but has the side effect that vault changes no longer appear in Magit diffs.</p> <p>Does anybody know how to make this work in our lovely Magit?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jakob1379"> /u/jakob1379 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf6fva/question_magit_does_not_show_diff_after_changing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wf6fva/question_magit_does_not_show_diff_after_changing/">[comments]</a></span>
