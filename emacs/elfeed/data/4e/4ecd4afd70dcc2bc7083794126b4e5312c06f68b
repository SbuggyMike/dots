<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently got the server in question and installed arch on it. When I installed the system, I got into htop and saw only one CPU core instead of two CPUs and four cores. After poking around in BIOS I found the option which, if enabled, causes Arch to detect CPUs correctly but breaks hpsa or systemd-udevd and disk detection (i. e. I can&#39;t see the disk and can&#39;t load rootfs). The option is named &quot;MPS Table mode&quot; and has two options: Full table APIC and &quot;Disabled&quot;. What should I do to fix it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mangooo256"> /u/Mangooo256 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/we65sv/hp_proliant_dl380_g5_does_strange_things/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/we65sv/hp_proliant_dl380_g5_does_strange_things/">[comments]</a></span>
