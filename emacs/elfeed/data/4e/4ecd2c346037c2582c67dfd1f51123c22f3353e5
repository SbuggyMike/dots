<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I currently have these settings in my init.el:</p> <pre><code>(require &#39;package) (setq package-archives &#39;((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;) (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;))) (package-initialize) </code></pre> <p>From what I read the &quot;org&quot; repository has been deprecated and there is no need for it anymore.</p> <p>As you can see, I do not have the <code>package-archive-priorities</code> defined in my config so I have no idea in which order my packages are fetched. I used Emacs like this for nearly two years until recently I discovered that <code>package-archive-priorities</code> exists, so I would like to make it part of my init.el now.</p> <p>I rewrote my package config:</p> <pre><code>(require &#39;package) (add-to-list &#39;package-archives &#39;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (add-to-list &#39;package-archives &#39;(&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;)) (setq package-archive-priorities &#39;((&quot;melpa&quot; . 3) (&quot;gnu&quot; . 2) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . 1))) (package-initialize) </code></pre> <p>The reason I add &quot;Non GNU&quot; is for Emacs 27. Yes, I know that Emacs 28+ doesn&#39;t require that.</p> <p>I set the highest priority for MELPA. I&#39;m using the numbers <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>1</code> for priorities. Is there anything wrong with that kind of numbering? Just asking because most init.el configs I saw online used larger integers like <code>100</code>, <code>50</code>, and <code>25</code>. Should I use the larger numbers instead? or it doesn&#39;t matter?</p> <p>Also, is there anything wrong in using the MELPA as the archive with the highest priority? I noticed that If I choose GNU ELPA as the main archive, the version of the <code>company</code> package that gets installed is an older version. It seems to me that the packages in MELPA are more up-to-date. The &quot;Non GNU&quot; archive doesn&#39;t seem to be a replacement for MELPA, at least not for now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zoliky"> /u/zoliky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wc9vl7/question_about_package_archives_and_package/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wc9vl7/question_about_package_archives_and_package/">[comments]</a></span>
