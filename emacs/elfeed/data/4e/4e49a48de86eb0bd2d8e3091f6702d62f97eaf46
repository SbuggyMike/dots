  Many of the refugees that the UK plans to send to Rwanda <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/05/female-trafficking-survivor-targeted-for-uk-removal-to-rwanda-says-charity">are victims
  of trafficking</a>.

  The fact that one particular refugee is a woman should make no

  trafficking (a form of enslavement) does make a difference.  Victims
  of trafficking must be protected so that they don't fear to report the
  crimes that were committed against them.

  The general attitude of the current UK government is towards law is,
  "Laws are weapons to hit you with &mdash; not tools for defending your
  rights."  <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-mar-jun.html#25_June_2022_(Tories_plan_to_weaken_European_Court_of_Human_Rights'_authority)">The plan to disempower the European Court of Human Rights</a> demonstrates this.
