<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I&#39;m very new to emacs and I wanted to try some of the tools available. I saw it has an ebook reader called nov (which seems to be the only maintained one) so I gave it a shot. I immediately noticed some issues with the rendering of the document. Here&#39;s a side by side of the exact same position in the book, rendered by nov on the left, and by zathura on the right, this is not a PDF, it&#39;s an epub file: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KcYblln.png">https://i.imgur.com/KcYblln.png</a></p> <p>Notice the complety lack of formatting on the first paragraph, or rather, at all. I don&#39;t think I need to point out the problems, they are pretty clear on their own.</p> <p>How can I fix this? Is it even possible to fix it?</p> <p>This is all the configuration I have for nov:</p> <pre><code>(setq nov-text-width 60) (setq visual-fill-column-center-text t) (add-to-list &#39;auto-mode-alist &#39;(&quot;\\.epub\\&#39;&quot; . nov-mode)) </code></pre> <p>I don&#39;t really know how to extend it to be honest, or anything at all. I understand very basic elisp (like function calls and setting variables) but that&#39;s it. I do have plenty of programming experience, I just don&#39;t know elisp well enough yet.</p> <p>I&#39;ve searched through the internet but there&#39;s very few results, and the few there were kinda went over my head. Any help is appreciated, thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooPets20"> /u/SnooPets20 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wh4fgm/nov_ebook_reader_problems_with_rendering/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wh4fgm/nov_ebook_reader_problems_with_rendering/">[comments]</a></span>
