<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yesterday something strange happened, something that never happened to me.</p> <p>Basically after resetting the CMOS (MOBO: Asrock X370 Gaming K4) Linux won&#39;t boot anymore with a message around the lines of</p> <pre><code>ata8: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300) ata6: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300) ata7: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300) ata5: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300) </code></pre> <p>I thought that my installation was broken, I reinstalled. Everything seemed fine but after a while I rebooted and it happened again. I swapped disks thinking my SSD died, no results whatsoever, after updating linux and linux-headers I can&#39;t reboot nor shut it down or else this will come up and I won&#39;t be able to boot it up again. </p> <p>Any solutions for this? I am on the verge of not using Linux anymore because I literally can&#39;t run it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cristagolem"> /u/Cristagolem </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfdjje/sata_link_down_hunts_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wfdjje/sata_link_down_hunts_me/">[comments]</a></span>
