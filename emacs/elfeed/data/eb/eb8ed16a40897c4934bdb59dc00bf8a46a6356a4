<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The hearing was going to take place on 28th July 2022 about BCCI wanting to change its constitution regarding 3 years cooling off period after holding post for 6 years. As **Jay Shah** and **Ganguly** about to complete 6 years ( 3 years as respective state president of Gujrat and W Bengal and 3 years as BCCI secretary and president) BCCI wants to change this clause so these two can further continue without 3 years of cooling period but when I searched about this hearing there is no news article available online not that I could access. I googled and all the articles available there of either 20th July or 21st July telling hearing has been postponed to 28th July but there are no article after that. does anybody have any Idea regarding hearing on 28th July? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/anfuman"> /u/anfuman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/whhhxi/what_happened_to_the_bcci_plea_in_sc_to_change/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/whhhxi/what_happened_to_the_bcci_plea_in_sc_to_change/">[comments]</a></span>
