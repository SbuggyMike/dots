<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I have an audio interface (20 outputs) that I use on my desktop. To use this as a stereo card, so that applications do not mistake it as a surround card, I remap AUX0 and AUX1 to a stereo loopback sink. At least, I used to, using pipewire-media-session. I did this as shown below.</p> <p><code> { name = libpipewire-module-loopback args = { node.name = &quot;Audient_iD44_Stereo&quot; node.description = &quot;Audient iD44 Stereo&quot; capture.props = { media.class = &quot;Audio/Sink&quot; audio.position = [ FL FR ] } playback.props = { audio.position = [ AUX0 AUX1 ] node.target = &quot;alsa_output.usb-Audient_Audient_iD44-00.pro-output-0&quot; stream.dont-remix = true node.passive = true } } } </code></p> <p>Previously I was using pipewire-media-session but now wireplumber seems to be what is required by pipewire. I cannot find any sources on how to configure wireplumber to do the same, and I find its documentation regarding config options extremely lacking. Is there anyone who knows how to solve this issue or that can point me to a good resource?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BlazingThunder30"> /u/BlazingThunder30 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wahggl/wireplumber_remap_usb_audio_interface/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wahggl/wireplumber_remap_usb_audio_interface/">[comments]</a></span>
