<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All,</p> <p>I come in peace requesting assistance for an issue I am unsure on how to troubleshoot. </p> <p>I have a Lindy Connection Perfection HDMI, audio, USB KVM switch and I am using this to share peripherals between my Arch Linux tower and my windows work laptop. </p> <p>Everything works as expected in terms of basic connectivity, I can switch in between with no problem everything is detected. </p> <p>The part I cannot figure out is why the keyboard and mouse, only the USB, cut out on my tower. I can happily type on windows no issue when I switch the keyboard/mouse turn off for a split second when I am typing om the Arch box. </p> <p>Things I tried:</p> <p>Changing the cables around to ensure the KVM USB connecting to the tower is not the issue(same behaviour) Turning off the windows pc during use(same behaviour) Changingcabless/peripheral (same behaviour)</p> <p>When I look in dmesg I can see connecting and disconnecting but I cannot understand why. </p> <p>The support at Lyndy said they cannot change it as it is meant to be universally compatible and is is a plug and play no extra drivers needed. </p> <p>Any suggestions are highly appreciated. </p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CyberSamantha"> /u/CyberSamantha </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/130gy3k/pointers_to_troubleshoot_hardware_kvm_usb_issue/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/130gy3k/pointers_to_troubleshoot_hardware_kvm_usb_issue/">[comments]</a></span>
