<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is it possible to change my laptop&#39;s battery alarm level by modifying the value in /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/alarm or is it set by the hardware? Is there any way to change this threshold value? I have a script on my other laptop that fires up a notification whenever the battery level is below 10 percent [through udev rules]. On that laptop, the alarm level is near 20 percent battery level. However, on my newly purchased (refurbished) laptop, it is set to nearly 5 percent of the battery level. It would be great if I could change this threshold level.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/i8ad8"> /u/i8ad8 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13116lh/change_battery_alarm_threshold/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/13116lh/change_battery_alarm_threshold/">[comments]</a></span>
