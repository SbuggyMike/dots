<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an electric piano at home, and one of the tone options is “strings,” and I really like the sound of it, but it doesn’t sound like any stringed instrument I’m familiar with. Does anyone know what kind of instrument or instruments it is? And also can anyone recommend some music that uses it? Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/danielandtrent"> /u/danielandtrent </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wdu9j8/help_finding_an_instrument/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wdu9j8/help_finding_an_instrument/">[comments]</a></span>
