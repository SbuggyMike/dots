<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always had an idea of a podcast like this in my mind, and wanted this subreddit&#39;s opinion on whether or not it&#39;s a good idea and if they would listen to it.</p> <p>It would be cricket podcast that focuses exclusively on one player per episode. Each episode would do a complete deep dive on the player, from the beginnings of their cricket journey, highlights of their best performances, how they were viewed amongst fans, any possible scandals, their possible decline and life after cricket (if they retired). Many great cricket podcasts focus on entire countries and matches, but I&#39;m not aware of any that do deep dives into individual players like this (If you do know of any, please let me know). </p> <p>Though the podcast could assess superstar players we all know of, I wanted to keep it mostly focused on the everyday, fairly unheralded cricketers who maybe never made the limelight that often. Every cricket fan knows the career story of Sachin Tendulkar, a 16 year old debutant who would later become the God of Cricket. Even casual fans can mention a notable innings or two of a relatively less iconic player... the Asad Shafiq&#39;s and Chris Jordan&#39;s of the cricketing world.</p> <p>But what about the other guys? What about Mohammad Talha, the Pakistani pacer who made his debut at home against Sri Lanka, only for the match to end prematurely because of the 2009 attack? His next test came 5 years later, and faded into obscurity...</p> <p>Have you heard of Dan Cullen? Australian offspinner who played one of his 5 international matches in Kaula Lumpur, and after his one test cap now works as a firefighter.</p> <p>As a relatively young cricket fan, it could also be an enlightening experience for me to dig a little deeper into cricket history. Way down the line maybe there are opportunities for interviews. I imagine each episode would be a fairly short (15-25 mins) investigation and cover of a player, and maybe the listener walks away picking up one or two interesting tidbits about a player they may have heard of but never got to know. </p> <p>Please let me know your thoughts on this idea, any criticisms or suggestions, whether or not you would listen to it, or just feel free to tell me it&#39;s a stupid idea and I should drop it.</p> <p>All the best, thanks for reading :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shoaibmalik18"> /u/shoaibmalik18 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wcgn9j/thoughts_on_a_podcast_idea/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/wcgn9j/thoughts_on_a_podcast_idea/">[comments]</a></span>
