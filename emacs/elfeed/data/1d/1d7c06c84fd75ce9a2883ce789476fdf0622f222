<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When asked to name the good ones, he mentioned the Kasparov series, any books by Boris Gelfand and Vishy, and that most games collection books by top players are &quot;decent&quot;.</p> <p>So, that leaves 10% good books for me. I’ll take those odds!</p> <p>So, which ones are your favourite chess books/series? Mine are the Gelfand series by Quality Chess; it’s written by Jacob Aagaard based on conversations he had with Boris and of course, the Grandmaster Preparation series.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cross_examination"> /u/Cross_examination </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/130iwb7/just_now_on_the_wc_commentary_speaking_of_chess/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/130iwb7/just_now_on_the_wc_commentary_speaking_of_chess/">[comments]</a></span>
