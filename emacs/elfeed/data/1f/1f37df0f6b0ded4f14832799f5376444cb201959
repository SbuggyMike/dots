Governor Dementis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/ron-desantis-suspends-andrew-warren-prosector-abortion-ban">"suspended" the elected state prosecutor of Tampa</a>,
who said he would refuse to prosecute anyone for abortions, and
put in his place a nonelected prosecutor.

I suppose Dementis has chosen a replacement who will eagerly prosecute
abortions.  I wonder when the citizens of Tampa will have another chance
to elect a prosecutor.
