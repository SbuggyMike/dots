<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I an an arch newbie and was just wondering how many of you guys use arch as your only daily driver linux distro or do you have a just works distro setup on the side??</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Backstory: I &quot;tried&quot; arch around christmas 2021 after approximately 9 months of diving into linux headfirst from hackintoshing. It quickly became my daily driver and my linux mint languished. Currently I have fedora 36 spins setup as &quot;just works&quot;. . . I never use it but keep it for now just in case my Arch breaks. At this point I feel like I can just spin up another arch PDQ. . . or use any distro live usb to fix what may be broken. I&#39;m considering deleting fedora spins and adding it to my mdadm raid home partition.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Im-Mostly-Confused"> /u/Im-Mostly-Confused </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7r3sg/do_you_keep_a_just_works_distro_loaded_in_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w7r3sg/do_you_keep_a_just_works_distro_loaded_in_your/">[comments]</a></span>
