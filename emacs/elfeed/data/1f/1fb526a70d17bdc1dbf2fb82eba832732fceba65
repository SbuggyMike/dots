<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve already installed Rust using rustup and rustup was installed from the script provided by the official website. Now if I have to install any package which uses Rust as its dependency, pacman will try to install Rust again. Is there any way to avoid this so that â €pacman will use rust installed in the system?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The9thHuman"> /u/The9thHuman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wf2c7w/how_to_get_aur_packages_to_use_system_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/wf2c7w/how_to_get_aur_packages_to_use_system_rust/">[comments]</a></span>
