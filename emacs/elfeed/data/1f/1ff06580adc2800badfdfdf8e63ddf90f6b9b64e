Coffee shops in Ukraine have "security cameras" that should better be
called "insecurity cameras", because Russian crackers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/russian-hackers-target-security-cameras-inside-ukraine-coffee-shops">broke their
    security</a> in order to snoop on Ukrainian convoys.
