<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to clone the contents of a local directory /foo/ into /foo/ on a remote machine. The directory /foo/ and contents are owned by root:homestar with permissions 640. The remote machine is running an ssh server with both password authentication and root login disabled. The local machine is not running an ssh server. I have root access on both machines and my user has sudo permissions on both machines, the ability to ssh into the remote machine, and is in group homestar. I have tried to do the cloning with</p> <p><code>$ sudo sshfs strongbad@poopsmith:// tmp -o Identityfile=strongbad_rsa -o allow_root</code></p> <p><code>$ sudo rsync -vaH --delete --force --chmod=D0750,F0640 --usermap=*:root --groupmap=*:homestar /foo/ tmp/foo</code></p> <p>but get a &quot;permission denied&quot; error. I think the error is because the allow_root option only affects the local machine and not the remote machine. How do I clone a local directory owned by root onto a remote machine?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AppointmentNearby161"> /u/AppointmentNearby161 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w245ui/how_to_clone_files_owned_by_root_between_2/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w245ui/how_to_clone_files_owned_by_root_between_2/">[comments]</a></span>
