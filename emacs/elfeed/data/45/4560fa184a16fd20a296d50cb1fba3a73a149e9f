Feel free to submit it here as long as you have an audio file/video/musical score of the piece. Mediums that generally work best include Vocaroo or YouTube links. If you do submit a YouTube link, please include a linked timestamp if possible or state the timestamp in the comment. <strong>Please refrain from typing things like: what is the Beethoven piece that goes &quot;Do do dooo Do do DUM&quot;, etc.</strong></p> <p>Other resources that may help:</p> <p>- <a href="https://www.musipedia.org/">Musipedia</a> - melody search engine. Search by rhythm, play it on piano or whistle into the computer.</p> <p>- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/">r/tipofmytongue</a> - a subreddit for finding anything you can’t remember the name of!</p> <p>- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/">r/namethatsong</a> - may be useful if you are unsure whether it’s classical or not</p> <p>- <a href="https://www.shazam.com/amp/">Shazam</a> - good if you heard it on the radio, in an advert etc. May not be as useful for singing.</p> <p>- you can also ask Google ‘What’s this song?’ and sing/hum/play a melody for identification</p> <p>- <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1924685677798998/">Facebook &#39;Guess The Score&#39; group</a> - for identifying pieces from the score</p> <p>A big thank you to all the lovely people that visit this thread to help solve users’ earworms every week.
