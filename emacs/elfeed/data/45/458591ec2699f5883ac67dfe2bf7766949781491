  US citizens: call on Congress to <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/forms/sign-the-petition-impeach-justice-clarence-thomas">impeach Justice Thomas</a>.
<p>
Thomas's corruption serves Republican interests, so I expect they
won't vote to impeach him, or vote to remove him from office if he has
been impeached.  Nonetheless, it may help strengthen the will to do
other things, such as expand the Supreme Court, after the next
election.
