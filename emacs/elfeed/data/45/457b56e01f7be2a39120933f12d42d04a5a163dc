<p>Eli Zaretskii writes to say that <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2023-05/msg00379.html">the second pretest of Emacs 29.1 is available for testing</a>. If you donâ€™t mind living a bit on the edge, Zaretskii would be grateful for your testing and letting the developers know of any problems you find.</p>
<p>As always, thanks to Eli and the other developers for their hard work in readying this latest release for our use. They are truly heroes and we owe them all our gratitude and, should the opportunity arise, a beer.</p>
