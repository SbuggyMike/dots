<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When i put the DVD in, it just starts to spin and doesn&#39;t stop spinning at what seems to be a constant speed... On my previous Manjaro install (5 months ago), it did work, but since then i haven&#39;t used it much (cause i only ever use it for some old backup DVDs), and never needed it on Arch til now, so i didn&#39;t bother to check, i just assumed it&#39;s fine...</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Well, it&#39;s not i guess, Arch doesn&#39;t either recognize it or something else...</p> <p>Can someone please help me troubleshoot this?</p> <p>Other removable media such as USBs work. Just the DVD.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure if fdisk -l is supposed to list the dvd drive, but it doesn&#39;t list it.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Please help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Veprovina"> /u/Veprovina </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/132e68s/dvd_drive_not_workingrecognized/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/132e68s/dvd_drive_not_workingrecognized/">[comments]</a></span>
