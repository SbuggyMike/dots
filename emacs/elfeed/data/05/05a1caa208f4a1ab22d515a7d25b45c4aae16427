In case you missed my previous post, the idea is to analyze your games and suggest forcing variations that put pressure on your opponent, as well as using statistics from the &quot;Opening Explorer&quot; to find common traps and mistakes.</p> <p>I would like to thank you all for your valuable feedback, and would like to report my updates. Specifically, I&#39;ve turned the tool into a Chrome extension that you can use directly on Lichess! This way you don&#39;t have to leave the site, which a few people commented on.</p> <p>At its current phase it just tracks your repertoire, by keeping your repertoire handy and showing it to you at the end of every game. Check out the video below for a quick summary. The <a href="https://github.com/gkousouris/chess-repertoire-builder">code</a> has a lot of bugs (anyone who wants to investigate, feel free xD). It also has steps on how to add it to your lichess and try it out. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><a href="https://reddit.com/link/1327slc/video/s4npnoajiowa1/player">v1 of my repertoire builder. Playing games and keeping track of the opening tree.</a></p> <p>The main reason I am posting is to ask for your feedback and suggestions on how to make the tool even better. A lot of the ideas for this v1 came from Reddit last time! Feel free to leave a comment here or DM me directly. Again, I will reply to every single person who comments!</p> <p>Thanks a lot for your feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RedPanda782"> /u/RedPanda782 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1327slc/where_did_my_opening_go_wrong_a_tool_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1327slc/where_did_my_opening_go_wrong_a_tool_for/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
