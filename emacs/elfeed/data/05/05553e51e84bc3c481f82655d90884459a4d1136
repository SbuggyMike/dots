A concert to benefit poor musicians in the UK accidentally used a
copyrighted work.  The collecting society PRS charged it a fee that
amounts to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/20/london-charity-concert-told-to-pay-1000-in-embarrassing-copyright-row">half the money</a>
it had raised, and thus revealed it has the
attitude of a parasite.
<p>
Copyright is an extremely bad way of supporting musicians and
composers.  We should allow noncommercial use of music with no fee,
and for supporting musicians and composers, we should

other systems</a>
for that.
