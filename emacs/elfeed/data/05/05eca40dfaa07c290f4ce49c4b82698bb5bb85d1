<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I noticed that when I run Emacs as a daemon the emacsclient -e &quot;(functions)&quot; runs with the buffer set as *server*.</p> <p>Suppose I have already an emacsclient instance with another buffer opened, for example &quot;sample.org&quot;. How can I ensure that if I run a function, such as emacsclient -e &quot;(flyspell-buffer)&quot;, the function is executed with the buffer being set correctly to &quot;sample.org&quot;?</p> <p>I am asking because I have noticed that emascsclient -e &quot;(buffer-name)&quot; returns *server* buffer all the time and it has weird behavior with functions that expect the buffer set correctly.</p> <p>Is there a way to do this from Emacs, without relying on the window manager?</p> <p>EDIT: There is no easy solution for this. I will just stick to Alt-x.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kamui78"> /u/kamui78 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138mp2n/how_to_set_the_buffer_properly_when_running/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/138mp2n/how_to_set_the_buffer_properly_when_running/">[comments]</a></span>
