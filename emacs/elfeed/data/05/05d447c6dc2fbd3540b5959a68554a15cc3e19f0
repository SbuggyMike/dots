<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Often when I havent updated my system in a while, I get problems with gpg signatures upon updating the system. Every time this happens, I need to update the archlinux-keyring before once again running -Syu. Why doesnt pacman see that theres a newer keyring for and updates that before everything else? Wouldnt this make &quot;late system upgrades&quot; easier for everybody?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Druz3"> /u/Druz3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6kwm7/why_arent_the_archlinuxkeyring_package/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w6kwm7/why_arent_the_archlinuxkeyring_package/">[comments]</a></span>
