The project to build a giant telescope with a 30-meter mirror on Mauna
Kea is advancing but has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/20/thirty-meter-telescope-mauna-kea-environmental-impact">delayed for a new environmental impact
study</a>.
<p>
Indigenous Hawai'ians demand that we stop the project, but they cite
only their emotions as reasons why, with no rational basis.  They
demand we obey their feelings, but there is no reason we should.
<p>
People who appreciate science look forward to advancing our knowledge
of the history of the universe.  The desire to understand the world is
also emotional, but there is a clear and rational aspect to it as well.
<p>
I hope to live long enough to appreciate some of the discoveries that
this telescope will give us.
