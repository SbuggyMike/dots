<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A while ago I created a software, called <a href="https://gitlab.com/es20490446e/exeCute">exeCute</a>, which simplifies the usage of Wine and DosBox. Same as Proton, but more targeted to use on the desktop outside Steam.</p> <p>exeCute automates most things around configuring Wine. You just have to click on the executable you want, and exeCute configures Wine optimally.</p> <p>Lately I have been improving it drastically, and now it automates all these things:</p> <p>- Selects if to launch with Wine or Dosbox.</p> <p>- Installs dxvk vkd3d, so all DirectX applications run fast using Vulkan as backend. Skips if the GPU doesn&#39;t support Vulkan.</p> <p>- Mounts any disk image found in the executable folder, simulating a physical disc.</p> <p>- Sets DPI according to the current resolution.</p> <p>- Restores desktop resolution if Wine hasn&#39;t done so.</p> <p>- Enables quality midi through Fluidsynth and soundfont-generaluser.</p> <p>- Simulates a virtual desktop if you place a &quot;desktop.conf&quot; file in the application folder with the desktop resolution you want.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/es20490446e"> /u/es20490446e </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12ysjlo/improved_wine_gaming_with_execute/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12ysjlo/improved_wine_gaming_with_execute/">[comments]</a></span>
