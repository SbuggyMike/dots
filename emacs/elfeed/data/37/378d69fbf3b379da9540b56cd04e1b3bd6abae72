<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I first installed Endeavor OS because I wanted to get into cybersecurity and I had heard that Linux was the best bet. But due to incompatibility reasons I want to switch back to windows and either dual boot or just boot from a USB. The only tools I have at my disposal are the archlinux laptop and a 8gb USB im not sure if its important but its running something Kde.<br/> PS: I know practically nothing about how to use Linux other than gitclone, ls, cd and stuff like that the only reason I was able to install this was by a friend but hes busy for a couple of weeks and i would like to switch back asap</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/9bow57"> /u/9bow57 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w297z8/how_to_install_windows_10_on_archlinux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w297z8/how_to_install_windows_10_on_archlinux/">[comments]</a></span>
