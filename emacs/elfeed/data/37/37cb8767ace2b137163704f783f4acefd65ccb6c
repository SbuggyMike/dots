<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve recently learned about Flatpaks and flathub has alot of software that isn’t verified. Like Brave and LibreWolf browser and Discord. Why are such major apps not verified on flathub and how do I know who put together the flathub? They have a link to the official GitHub but if they are not verified doesn’t that mean anyone put it together and is simply linking to the original?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rubiblu"> /u/rubiblu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12z8p8d/are_flatpaks_that_are_unverified_safe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12z8p8d/are_flatpaks_that_are_unverified_safe/">[comments]</a></span>
