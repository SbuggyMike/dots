<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was just a regular guy who liked computers and gadgets a lot. I started using Linux as my primary OS about a year ago. It&#39;s been quite an adventure. From struggling to install a distro, then distro-hopping, falling in love with CLI and TUI programs, to settling on Arch and then discovering window managers and a whole another world of customization. During this time, I kept learning more and more about free and open-source software. I was really fascinated by it -- so much so that I wanted to contribute to it. So I decided to learn to code. Started out with Python and now I&#39;m learning Rust along with it. So far, I&#39;ve built a <a href="https://github.com/VoltaireNoir/track">TUI program</a> in Python to track activities, a WhatsApp web automation library (WIP) and now a Rust CLI utility to manage backlight on Linux (especially on laptops with Hybrid GPU configuration) which I recently <a href="https://crates.io/crates/blight">published on Crates.io</a>. All of them, free and open-source. </p> <p>I just wanted to share this small story about my journey with Linux, and I want to say that it&#39;s been wonderful being part of the community and learning and growing along the way. I&#39;m still a beginner and I have a lot to learn, but now I wake up everyday feeling excited to learn and build more. And I can&#39;t wait to contribute to the projects that I rely on everyday. I don&#39;t think I would be doing what I&#39;m doing now if I hadn&#39;t decided to install Linux that day. So yeah, cheers to that!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drag0nryd3r"> /u/drag0nryd3r </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wh113r/my_journey_with_linux_from_a_total_noob_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wh113r/my_journey_with_linux_from_a_total_noob_to/">[comments]</a></span>
