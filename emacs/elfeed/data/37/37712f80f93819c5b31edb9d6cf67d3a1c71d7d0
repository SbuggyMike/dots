<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Anyone have a similar setup that has working graphics? I know this is fairly new laptop and support is not the best on new stuff but i thought i would take a chance. I am having graphics issues where the screen does not refresh unless the mouse moves over the location, also when moving the mouse, i get wild glitchy graphics that produces horizontal lines across the whole screen and the screen sort of jumps all around. </p> <p>Its got a UHD 3840 x 2400 touch screen if that may be causing issues too. </p> <p>Anyone have a similar setup working, and what you might have done to get it working?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/burrfree"> /u/burrfree </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzfot4/graphics_issues_new_dell_xps_9720_with_rtx_3050/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vzfot4/graphics_issues_new_dell_xps_9720_with_rtx_3050/">[comments]</a></span>
