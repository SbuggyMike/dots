Germany will reactivate old, closed coal power 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/08/germany-reactivate-coal-power-plants-russia-curbs-gas-flow">plants to cope with the
lack of Russian natural gas.</a>
<p>
Since gas causes as much global heating as coal does, this
substitution may not do any net harm.  But what will happen to the gas
that Russia is not selling to Germany?
<p>
Will Russia leave some in the ground?  (I've read it is not feasible
to entirely shut off extracting gas.)  Will Russia sell it elsewhere?
Will Russia burn it at the well-head, for the lack of any place to put
it?
