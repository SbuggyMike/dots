*A group of whistleblowers has provided evidence that the
 Environmental Protection Agency has <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/08/01/epa-chemical-assessments-health-risks-cancer-whistleblowers/">not adequately assessed the
 health risks</a> posed by several new chemicals on the grounds that they
 are corrosive. Managers in the New Chemicals Division have repeatedly
 and incorrectly used the idea that a chemical may cause irritation to
 the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract as an excuse to avoid assessing
 the risk of other harms it may cause.*
