<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I&#39;m not a musician and I don&#39;t know any so hopefully someone here is willing to enlighten me. I need to study the score of Schoenberg&#39;s second string quartet but I can&#39;t read music and don&#39;t know how to learn, and I have no idea how to acquire the score. So how do I learn to read music? And how do I get that score? Please help and thankyou.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wamyl5/how_to_learn_to_read_music_and_study_a_score/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wamyl5/how_to_learn_to_read_music_and_study_a_score/">[comments]</a></span>
