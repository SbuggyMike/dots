<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had this problem for a while now, and unfortunately I can&#39;t pinpoint when it started occuring. I do however know that it wasn&#39;t an issue until at most 6 months ago.</p> <p>When opening the lid of my laptop, the wireless connection is disabled and I have to manually enable it again. <code>journalctl -f</code> shows</p> <p><code>kernel: wlo1: deauthenticating from [MAC address] by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)</code></p> <p>right before <code>Lid opened</code>. When the lid is closed, the connection remains on as usual.</p> <p>The strangest thing is that this doesn&#39;t always happen. Upon reboots, it&#39;s possible that during that session this issue does not occur. However, if it does occur, it always occurs when opening the lid during that session.</p> <p>My laptop has an Intel 7265 wireless controller using the <code>iwlwifi</code> firmware. I use NetworkManager, and if it matters, its <code>plasma-nm</code> frontend for KDE Plasma. I&#39;ve disabled MAC randomization using the method in the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#Configuring_MAC_address_randomization">wiki</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pryingmantis89"> /u/pryingmantis89 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w1aa1o/wireless_connection_disabled_when_opening_laptop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w1aa1o/wireless_connection_disabled_when_opening_laptop/">[comments]</a></span>
