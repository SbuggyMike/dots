<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a rather odd question. I am travelling South East Asia with friends at the moment and will be in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnman tomorrow. Iâ€™d like to watch the tie-breakers at a bar/social setting rather than my room as I plan to go out right after it finishes. Does anyone here know of any bars/fun spaces ( that serve alcohol preferably) that might show the match? </p> <p>thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/White_Diamond_better"> /u/White_Diamond_better </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132yudp/chess_bar_in_ho_chi_minh/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/132yudp/chess_bar_in_ho_chi_minh/">[comments]</a></span>
