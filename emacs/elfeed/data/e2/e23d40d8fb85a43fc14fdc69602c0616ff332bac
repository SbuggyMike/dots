<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all!</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using corfu and evil mode for a while now and I have one small thing that I cannot seem to get working.</p> <p>I would like to map escape to do the same thing as the return key, i.e: keep the autocompleted selection and close the corfu window. </p> <p>I&#39;ve tried mapping escape to corfu-insert many different ways but none seem to work - escape always keeps resetting the autocompletion. I even tried editing the default mappings in corfu.el, changing corfu-reset to corfu-insert with no luck..</p> <p>What am I missing? The idea seems fairly simple yet for the life of me I can&#39;t get it working. Please help!</p> <p>Also, it&#39;d be awesome if I could run the evil-normal-state command after corfu-insert as well, so I can press escape, keep the autocompletion and go back to normal mode. That would be the ideal senario anyway.</p> <p>Thanks in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lifer0se"> /u/lifer0se </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w0umyd/need_help_with_corfu_keybinding/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w0umyd/need_help_with_corfu_keybinding/">[comments]</a></span>
