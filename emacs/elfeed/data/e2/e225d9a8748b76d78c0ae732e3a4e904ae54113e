<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to the classical music world. I love Vivaldi 4 seasons as played on string quartet. Could you guys introduce me to any other artists/works that sound as good or maybe even better on string quartet? Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nova_210"> /u/nova_210 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8gwf6/betteras_good_as_vivaldi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/w8gwf6/betteras_good_as_vivaldi/">[comments]</a></span>
