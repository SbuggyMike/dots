<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The government and media have downplayed the possibility of a recession right up to this point and my gut feeling is that things are going to be much worse than currently expected by the majority of people.</p> <p>I don&#39;t think Putin is anywhere near done leveraging energy against Europe, he&#39;s probably only just getting started. It goes without saying I fully support the Ukraine and I hope they get the bastard !</p> <p>How many people can realistically afford Â£4000+ per year on energy bills ????? That&#39;s before taking into consideration the rising interest rates that are going to cripple people in other ways.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently in the process of trying to get the money together for a solar setup as this is the only real way of bringing down the cost of energy, we cannot cut our usage anymore than we already have.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lo_jak"> /u/Lo_jak </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/wgqgex/does_anyone_else_think_that_the_coming_recession/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/wgqgex/does_anyone_else_think_that_the_coming_recession/">[comments]</a></span>
