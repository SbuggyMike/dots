When UK "anti-terrorist" <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> questioned French publisher Ernest Moret,
supposedly about "terrorism", they asked him questions about his
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/19/french-publisher-arrested-in-london-was-asked-about-support-for-macron">positions
in French politics</a>,
such as whether he supported President Macron and
whether he had protested against Macron's pension delay law.
<p>
This catches them red-handed in dishonest use of these special powers,
which violate human rights.
<p>
It is not enough to drop charges against Moret.  The UK must restore
its respect for human rights.
