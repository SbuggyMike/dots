<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Rach 2: richter, lugansky, grimaud, kissin </p> <p>Rach 3: kissin, (please donâ€™t crucify me i know the first movement is terrible except for the cadenza and the second is average but the third is absolutely perfect. His 1996 with Mehta was much better than well known bso and ozawa recording. Also he might play it again this concert season so yay maybe we get a rlly rlly good one this time?)
