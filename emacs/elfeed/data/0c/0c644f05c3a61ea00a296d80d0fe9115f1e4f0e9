<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>edit: SOLVED! I just didn&#39;t have linux-firmware installed correctly lmao, i installed that and then my wi-fi driver automatically installed</p> <p>I&#39;m a very new Arch user, and when I was running it off my USB to install it, I was able to connect to my Wi-Fi fine, but now Arch is installed, and no Wi-Fi networks are even showing? What&#39;s going on? My laptop&#39;s Wi-Fi light is off, but the Bluetooth light is on despite the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth being on the same card? Ethernet is also working fine, but since this is my laptop, I want Wi-Fi. Anyone know how I could get it to work?</p> <p>SPECS:</p> <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T420</p> <p>Intel Core i5-2520m</p> <p>2x4GB Samsung 1333MHz DDR3 RAM</p> <p>Intel HD Graphics 3000</p> <p>120GB Kingston SSDNow 300</p> <p>Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lost-Entrepreneur439"> /u/Lost-Entrepreneur439 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vxych0/very_new_arch_user_here_my_wifi_was_working_when/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/vxych0/very_new_arch_user_here_my_wifi_was_working_when/">[comments]</a></span>
