A member of the Danish parliament that represents Greenland <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/12/greenlandic-mp-refuses-to-speak-danish-in-parliament-debate">gave a
    speech in Parliament in Greenlandic</a>, which no one else there
understood.  Then she refused to tell the rest of parliament what the
speech meant.
<p>
To speak to a body of people in a language almost none of them
understand is disrespectful.  When they ask you to repeat your point
in their language, which you do speak, it indicates they do wish to
pay attention to your point.  To refuse them only vents contempt.
<p>
If you pretend that asking you what you said represents an attempt to
gag you, that is perverse and unjust.

The other parliamentarians might respond, "While you speak to us in a
language we can't understand, we may as well use the time to catch up
on documents we are supposed to read."
