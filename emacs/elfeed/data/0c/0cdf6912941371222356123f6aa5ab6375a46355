<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished this great essay by a favorite author of mine. Definitely recommend it. It&#39;s fairly dated now but a lot of the content interestingly still holds up today. Explores the nature of the operating system market and Windows/Mac/Linux from a standpoint that doesn&#39;t require a technical background. One thing I&#39;m curious about... Stephenson makes it very clear that he is on the Linux side of the discussion, and perhaps he is biased, but he makes Linux systems to be unstoppable and Windows NT very buggy. However I recall the consensus on a different post asking &#39;what does windows offer that linux can&#39;t&#39; to be stability. I&#39;m not technically experienced and fairly young but I&#39;ve been messing around with linux since I was a kid. (First time installing a linux distro would have been somewhere around 2005 to 2010). Where along the way did Windows surpass Linux in terms of stability? Or are these perhaps differing definitions or contexts of what exactly is meant by &#39;stable&#39;?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Monolithx64"> /u/Monolithx64 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3606r/just_finished_neal_stephensons_in_the_beginning/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3606r/just_finished_neal_stephensons_in_the_beginning/">[comments]</a></span>
