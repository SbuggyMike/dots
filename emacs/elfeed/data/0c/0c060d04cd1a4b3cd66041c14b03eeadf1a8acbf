<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have (macos):</p> <ul> <li>emacs keys, not evil</li> <li>caps lock mapped to control</li> <li>left option as meta</li> <li>left command as super (not sure if I should change this to meta yet)</li> <li>right command mapped as F7</li> </ul> <p>This looks somewhat sane and I can easily bind the menu key in other keyboards to F7 (or other F key) as well. </p> <p>F7 is a prefix key and I’m using it as something similar to general.el as in “&lt;f7&gt;w” opens a prefix for my windows commands for example (like SPC w in doom or whatever).</p> <p>I wanted to map right command to hyper but that does not play nice with macos terminals.</p> <p>This is looking very nice to me, I honestly was not fully aware I could achieve this as I’m somewhat a beginner.</p> <p>I was using a lot of chords too but I reduced their usage due to some conflicts. They are still pretty awesome to have though (a quick “tt” opens vterm-toggle for example).</p> <p>Does this look sane to you guys? Is it too good to be true?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/guitmz"> /u/guitmz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w5oqcr/i_think_im_onto_something_another_keybinding_post/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w5oqcr/i_think_im_onto_something_another_keybinding_post/">[comments]</a></span>
