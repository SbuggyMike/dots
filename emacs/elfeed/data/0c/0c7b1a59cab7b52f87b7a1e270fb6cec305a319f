<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not sure if this is the place to ask, but I’m not really sure where else to do so. </p> <p>My friend (an amateur classical music composer for piano) once mentioned in passing that they want to have a good software to write down his compositions, so I’m thinking of buying them one as a surprise gift. While I listen to classical music, I know absolutely nothing about music composition, so I don’t know what to look for.</p> <p>Any recommendations on where to start would be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/anon110701"> /u/anon110701 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/witph6/software_for_classical_music_composition/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/witph6/software_for_classical_music_composition/">[comments]</a></span>
