The Ukraine-Russia border, between Kharkiv and Belgorod, was just an
arbitrary line, with similar people speaking the same form of
Ukrainian on both sides (often related to each other).  The war <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/18/ukraine-russia-border-war-citizens-identities">forced
    each person to choose a side</a>.

The two states, becoming increasingly different over time, created a
superstructure that made the two sites of the line terribly different.
Now one side of the line is under a repressive tyranny while the other
is under (imperfect) freedom.
