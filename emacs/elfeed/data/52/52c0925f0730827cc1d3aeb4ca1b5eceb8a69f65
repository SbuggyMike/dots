<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there a rulebook somewhere that outlines what is legal for chess sets in tournament Play? </p> <p>I used to play in tournaments as a child but only ever used cheap plastic sets. I&#39;d like to have a more comfortable set now that I&#39;m getting back into tournament Play but I can&#39;t seem to find rules/restrictions on what&#39;s allowed anywhere. Any help would be appreciated! Even US Chess never responded back to me when I asked.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RockSmon"> /u/RockSmon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wffsxp/us_tournament_chess_set_legality/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/wffsxp/us_tournament_chess_set_legality/">[comments]</a></span>
