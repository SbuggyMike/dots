<p>Over at the Emacs subreddit, Lalelul wants to know <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12uzlpm/how_can_i_fix_hard_to_read_gray_text_on_gray/">How can I fix hard to read (gray text on gray background) dialog boxe</a>? As soon as I saw it, I deleted the browser tab but I was too late. The Minions had noticed.</p>
<p>They started jumping up and down and insisted that I provide the answer: “Don’t use unreadable dark themes.” Problem solved.</p>
<p>RMF humor aside, why would anyone do this? In a sense it doesn’t matter because the users of these themes are hurting no one but themselves but the Minions—and to tell the truth, I—don’t understand why anyone who isn’t a misanthrope would design a theme in which the menus are unreadable. Maybe it’s a way of encouraging users to eschew menus and learn Emacs key sequences.</p>
<p>One of the features of Emacs is that it enables ultra-efficient editing but when you design themes that are hard or impossible to read, you’re nullifying that efficiency. To channel Nancy Reagan, “Just say no.”</p>
