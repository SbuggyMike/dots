<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tried to install my NVIDIA drivers on arch and now it doesn&#39;t boot. It just freezes on this when attempting to boot.</p> <pre><code>Starting version 251.3-1-arch /dev/nvme0n1p5: clean, 348962/1310720 files, 3437642/5242000 blocks </code></pre> <p>I think I know what&#39;s wrong though. It said to install the NVIDIA drivers I would have to disable the current drivers and it would put a file there to stop it or something, if I could just find that file, I could access it via a Linux USB and delete it. Can I do that (and if so can someone tell me where the file is, idk where it is) or am I fucked and just have to reinstall Arch?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lost-Entrepreneur439"> /u/Lost-Entrepreneur439 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2n6mn/i_ended_up_trying_to_install_my_gpu_driver_and_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2n6mn/i_ended_up_trying_to_install_my_gpu_driver_and_it/">[comments]</a></span>
