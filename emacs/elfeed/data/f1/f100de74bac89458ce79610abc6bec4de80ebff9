<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically the title. Took me a while to narrow down exactly what was happening.</p> <p>I&#39;m on emacs 27 and this is happening using the <code>rustic</code> package with <code>flycheck</code> and <code>eglot</code>.</p> <p>If I disable eldoc before it ever holds docs, I&#39;m not prompted to save.</p> <p>But If I look at something in eldoc, and even after I quit <code>eldoc-mode</code>, emacs wants to save only the examples section of eldoc.</p> <p>This is a bizarre error and I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s just a setting I have turned on? My next step is to dig into the eldoc code.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/granitrocky"> /u/granitrocky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vzpnq5/eldoc_is_trying_to_save_the_examples_section_into/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vzpnq5/eldoc_is_trying_to_save_the_examples_section_into/">[comments]</a></span>
