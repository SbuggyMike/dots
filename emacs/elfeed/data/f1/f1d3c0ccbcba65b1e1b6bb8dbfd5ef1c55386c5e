The Tories have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/11/rishi-sunak-again-opts-for-pragmatism-over-brexit-bombast-on-sunset-clause">delayed the plan to repeal thousands of EU-derived
    laws en masse</a>.
<p>
  That <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-scrapping-eu-rules-the-threat-remains">doesn't mean the laws won't be all be repealed en masse</a>.

Thoughtful and proper proceedings would be to allowing Parliament to
examine each of these laws, one by one, and judge whether the UK would
be better off keeping it, repealing it, or changing it.  That would be the
way to improve life in the UK.  Evidently that is not the goal.
