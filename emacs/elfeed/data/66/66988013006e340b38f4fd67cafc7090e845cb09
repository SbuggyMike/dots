<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I do not have any coding knowledge. I&#39;d like some help to learn how to pin point the issue in a backtrace debugger buffer. I got this weird bug now and I cant find what&#39;s wrong. Or may be there&#39;s other debugger packages available for Emacs that would be more specific about what&#39;s wrong in my init file that is causing this issue?</p> <p>When I&#39;m running &#39;C-g&#39; on &#39;M-x&#39; I get this backtrace now. That&#39;s new. The problem here is that I&#39;ve added a few stuff in my init file since before running &#39;C-g&#39; on &#39;M-x&#39;. There&#39;s no way now that I can recall what could be causing the issue. I definitely need to find what&#39;s causing this from a degugger.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the <a href="https://codeberg.org/danrobi/dotfiles/issues/1">backtrace</a>. I&#39;ve tried to look for something related with &#39;minibuffer-quit&#39; in my init file. There&#39;s nothing with &#39;minibuffer-quit&#39; anywhere in my init file. Here&#39;s my <a href="https://codeberg.org/danrobi/dotfiles/src/branch/main/emacs/init.el">init file</a></p> <p>Thank&#39;s for any help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Danrobi1"> /u/Danrobi1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w891db/need_help_to_debug_a_lisp_error/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w891db/need_help_to_debug_a_lisp_error/">[comments]</a></span>
