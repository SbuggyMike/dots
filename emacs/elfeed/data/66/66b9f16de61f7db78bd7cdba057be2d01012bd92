<p>David Wilson over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters">System Crafters</a> has an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPoF1PTZpI">informative video</a> on how he does the slides for his popular video series. The short answer is that he uses <a href="https://github.com/rlister/org-present">org-present</a>. With org-present you can take an ordinary Org file and have each top level header be a slide. As you’d expect, though, the results are elementary and don’t look particularly nice. Most of Wilson’s video focuses on the tweaks he makes to turn that elementary display into the pleasant and refined presentation slides that you see in his videos.</p>
<p>He starts by centering the text and increasing its size. That alone makes a big difference but the real improvement comes from making appropriate font changes. That means making most of the slide’s text render in a proportional font but keeping things like code in a mono faced font. Add in a little color and an appropriate theme and you’re almost there.</p>
<p>Finally, he adds a few touches to smooth out the look of the slides. The results are very pleasing and you only have to do the setup once. After that, just write the Org file and invoke org-present.</p>
<p>Wilson’s video is 29 minutes so you’ll need to schedule some time but if you you’re giving presentations, it’s well worth the time. He supplies a link to the configuration he discusses so there’s no need to try to copy it as you watch.</p>
