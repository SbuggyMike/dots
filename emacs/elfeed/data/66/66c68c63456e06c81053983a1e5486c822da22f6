<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve been daily driving Ubuntu and Windows for the past year now. My R tutor at university has finally given me the push to switch over and get used to Arch since he is such a huge fan of it. </p> <p>I’m ready to make the switch but I wanted to come to the experts to ask how gaming is on Arch Linux considering my tutor can’t comment on this since he isn’t a gamer. </p> <p>I mainly play RPGs on Steam so I assume this will be fine, but I question if some of the games I use on Windows to play with my friends will be stable on Arch. These include League, Valorant and Overwatch mainly. </p> <p>I assume with Riot Vanguard Valorant may be out of the question for now. But does anyone run these on Arch and do you have any advice overall for a gamer wanting to switch over?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jakos01"> /u/Jakos01 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/we3l4k/gaming_on_arch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/we3l4k/gaming_on_arch/">[comments]</a></span>
