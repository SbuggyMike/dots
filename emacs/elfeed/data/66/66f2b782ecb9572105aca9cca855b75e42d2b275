<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My hardware looks like its not being fully utilized on Arch. I get a higher framerate on Windows even in native games which doesn&#39;t really make sense. Could it be because of the legacy nvidia drivers?</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I tested CSGO and on Arch I got an average of 30fps but on Windows I got an average of 45fps. This really isn&#39;t right.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tested vkcube and wine + dxvk and it works fine so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a compatibility issue.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>GPU: Nvidia GT 710 2GB</p> <p>CPU: AMD FX-4100 Quad Core</p> <p>RAM: 16gb DDR3</p> <p>OS: Arch Linux</p> <p>Kernel: Xanmod</p> <p>WM: dwm</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Loomeh"> /u/Loomeh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2pn0a/hardware_not_fully_utilised/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w2pn0a/hardware_not_fully_utilised/">[comments]</a></span>
