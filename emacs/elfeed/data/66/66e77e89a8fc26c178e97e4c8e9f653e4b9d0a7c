Some black men run away from traffic stops because they are terrified
that

Rationally, the chance that any given black man will be killed in any
given traffic stop is minuscule.  But I can't blame them for feeling
terrified, given the thugs' patterns of bias and harassment.  There is
no reliable way for a black driver to get through a

safely &mdash; you can get shot for obeying the thugs' orders.</a>
