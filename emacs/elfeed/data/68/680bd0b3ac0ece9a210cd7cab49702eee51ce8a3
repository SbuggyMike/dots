<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I see a lot of people raging against Starmer on social media. Be it because they loved Corbyn and can&#39;t move on, or they see him as a closet Tory etc. I see things very simply- he is a vast improvement over the Tories, and for that he deserves a chance in number 10. FPTP may be rubbish, but for now we are stuck with it. Unless you live in a constituency where LD are the realistic party to win, a vote against Labour is a Tory vote. I find it really disheartening that so many people are willing to condemn everyone for such petty reasoning. If we wake up with another Tory government after the next election, then this country deserves all it gets.</p> <p>Please air your thoughts. Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/securinight"> /u/securinight </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/vzn7xp/will_people_really_let_the_tories_back_in_just/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/vzn7xp/will_people_really_let_the_tories_back_in_just/">[comments]</a></span>
