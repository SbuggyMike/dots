<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently tried the Open Source music play Moosync, and have been loving it, but recently noticed something, it writes to the disk. a lot, like 1.2MB/s CONSTANTLY while playing audio, the write total after 2 days of casual listening is 30GB, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be reading it either, given the read total of 2GB, All the music I&#39;m playing is stored locally, so caching doesn&#39;t make sense, and Clementine barely writes anything</p> <p>Can anyone shed some light on why this would be happening, and maybe how to lower its disk usage?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/I__be_Steve"> /u/I__be_Steve </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w4903y/not_sure_where_to_ask_about_this_so_i_decided_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w4903y/not_sure_where_to_ask_about_this_so_i_decided_to/">[comments]</a></span>
