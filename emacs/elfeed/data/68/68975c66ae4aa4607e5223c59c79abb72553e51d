His music could be said as repetitive or boring and has &quot;no melody&quot; but in reality his works are incredibly complex in musical structure and beautifully constructed making use of clever and audibly satisfying patterns, rhythms, and harmonies.</p> <p>One of his most famous example of rhythmic ingenuity would be his &quot;Bruckner Rhythm&quot; otherwise known as the two quarter notes, with triplet quarter notes that follows in a 2+3 pattern in 4/4 (and other similar variations of this like a reversal: 3+2 rhythm).</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/io4xuo0ahag91.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df70e001039dd3cfd469cdbeeb07cfffc1ca86b2">https://preview.redd.it/io4xuo0ahag91.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df70e001039dd3cfd469cdbeeb07cfffc1ca86b2</a></p> <p>But ever since becoming obsessed with Bruckner&#39;s music last year, I&#39;ve come to notice other rhythmic patterns employed heavily throughout his music that are being neglected and not given the same spotlight as the &quot;Bruckner Rhythm&quot;.</p> <p>I&#39;ve come to identify and list these rhythms that give the music its color and power.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>---</p> <p>First, the &quot;dotted note rhythm&quot;. Everybody knows just by looking at a Bruckner score, Bruckner loves to use dotted note rhythms, and sometimes even double or triple dotted notes. The most common throughout his works would be a dotted eighth note with a sixteenth note and either a quarter note after that, or the dotted eighth+sixteenth note rhythm repeated again. Something along the lines of this:</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/eaqjofc9hag91.png?width=2169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12c59eddfcdc338dac8e7e1358987fcb1b27029f">https://preview.redd.it/eaqjofc9hag91.png?width=2169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12c59eddfcdc338dac8e7e1358987fcb1b27029f</a></p> <p>Again many variations of this pattern are present throughout his works, well actually most of his works. I cannot think of one example where this rhythm does not exist in his works. Whether it be a reversal of this rhythm or a version that gets rid of the quarter note. A famous example of this rhythm is present in his fourth symphony, which is even more noticeable in his 1874 version of this symphony at the coda of the first movement. Of course I am the oddball for referencing this version of the fourth symphony that no one listens to, I just like the 1874 version over the 1878/80 version because of how &quot;rustic&quot; it sounds. And again, this rhythm is present throughout all his symphonies and religious music, such as at the end of the Gloria movement in his Mass No.3 f moll with the trumpets building more and more of the climax while the timpani roars over the choir shouting praise to the Lord with a final &quot;Amen&quot;.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>---</p> <p>Next, his &quot;scherzo rhythm&quot;. This rhythm comprises of two eighth notes followed by two quarter notes (then followed by three quarter notes). This rhythm occurs in the scherzo movement of his second and ninth symphonies as well as his (i forgor lol).</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/nk5w85o6hag91.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d47e94fa11fab22b50e1fa3ff58be3ca278162">https://preview.redd.it/nk5w85o6hag91.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d47e94fa11fab22b50e1fa3ff58be3ca278162</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>---</p> <p>Next, his &quot;downbeat Bruckner rhythm&quot;. this is just a version of the Bruckner rhythm but instead of the triplets, they are replaced with four eighth notes. This is an over simplified explanation though and a combination of the &quot;dotted note rhythm&quot; variations appears in some symphonies.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/iuub51k7hag91.png?width=2579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ad74de385792621582217c4588feefb15618b4">https://preview.redd.it/iuub51k7hag91.png?width=2579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ad74de385792621582217c4588feefb15618b4</a></p> <p>It is a rhythm that is quite noticeable in his seventh symphony: first movement, occurring quite often within the Violins. But my absolute all time favorite usage of this rhythm would probably be the coda for the Gloria movement in his Mass No.1 in d moll. The trumpets play the third variation of the rhythm shown above and it is a spectacular usage of this rhythm pairing together with the strings that are playing powerful quarter note chords all on down bow, &quot;hyping up&quot; the choir as they praise the Lord with a final and bombastic &quot;Amen&quot; over the sound of wonderful pipe organ.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>---</p> <p>Next, again a &quot;dotted note rhythm&quot; but this time it uses the entire measure (or two) giving a sense of completion or resolution to this rhythm as it would if it were a melody. I would nickname this the &quot;dotted note rhythm with a tail&quot;. This rhythm is composed of a dotted quarter note with an eighth note, then followed by two quarter notes. Other variations exists, such as a double dotted quarter note, sixteenth note, then followed by two quarter notes. Or one as double the value or one that represents the previous rhythmic example of the &quot;downbeat Bruckner rhythm&quot; with the last two quarter notes being replaced with eighth notes.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/bzsamts3hag91.png?width=1994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e53d0ed0b346cac78c92f86b03bd6c44cff9f7">https://preview.redd.it/bzsamts3hag91.png?width=1994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e53d0ed0b346cac78c92f86b03bd6c44cff9f7</a></p> <p>The sole example that is screaming in my head right now would be in the Te Deum: In Te, Domine speravi movement (finale). Also used in his String Quintet in F dur, starting off the adagio third movement with this rhythm, sublimely using it to start concluding the movement as well.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>---</p> <p>Finally, the rhythm that is like the &quot;scherzo rhythm&quot; but is in 4/4. This rhythm is comprised of a quarter note on the first beat followed by two eighth notes on the second beat, following that is two quarter notes. This rhythm commonly continues on with a melodic line that concludes on either the first or second beat of the next measure.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/a7petfa2hag91.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f95628de8ed2fba640f2fd24fcae963dfc3aff7">https://preview.redd.it/a7petfa2hag91.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f95628de8ed2fba640f2fd24fcae963dfc3aff7</a></p> <p>To be honest, I got tired of listening to all his works right now and I&#39;m quite burnt out resulting in me not being able to think of any examples of this rhythm right now.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>---</p> <p>I hope some of the intelligent minds in this community can find more examples of these rhythms, identify more unique rhythms found in his music, and the people who did not know these rhythms, to identify them when listening to Bruckner in the future.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I would like to thank Bartje Bartmans on YouTube for the Bruckner symphony score videos compiled on his channel.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Everybody please listen more to Bruckner, I understand many people do not understand his music but please try to love his music because he is a fantastic composer hidden in plain sight and all it takes is a bit of understanding to start exploring the vast musical talent he has given to us.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xoknight"> /u/xoknight </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wiet8k/list_of_brucknarian_rhythms_that_appear_commonly/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/wiet8k/list_of_brucknarian_rhythms_that_appear_commonly/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
