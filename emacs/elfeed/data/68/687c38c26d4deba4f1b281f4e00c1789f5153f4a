<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a computer engineering student looking internship roles for next summer and an area I&#39;m very interested in is embedded systems programming with C/C++/Python. </p> <p>I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with Linux as much and I was wondering if anyone has recommendations for learning the basics behind linux and how its used for embedded systems (processes, threads, file descriptors, syscalls, etc.)</p> <p>Thanks!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DK_Tech"> /u/DK_Tech </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wbq4hy/learning_linux_for_embedded_systems/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/wbq4hy/learning_linux_for_embedded_systems/">[comments]</a></span>
