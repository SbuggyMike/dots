<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m dealing with an issue with graphical applications such as RetroArch and Dosbox (about any graphical application) from whenever I&#39;m on tty whenever I launch something, the keyboard and mouse immediately break on me and cannot do anything, only press the pwr btn and power the system off. Is there a fix to this so I can use mouse and keyboard input on graphical applications through tui without issues?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TetraShot"> /u/TetraShot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3ff3z/input_immediately_breaks_when_launching_any/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w3ff3z/input_immediately_breaks_when_launching_any/">[comments]</a></span>
