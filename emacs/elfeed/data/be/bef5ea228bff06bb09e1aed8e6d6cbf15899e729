<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, hope you all doing great. So I’ve recently bought an asus vivobook s15 with amd ryzen with the igpu and I’ve started to install arch on it, and after exiting the live environment I felt that system freezes and I installed kde and it crashes all the time and it’s completely unusable. ( I installed amd open source driver for gpu and amd microcode for cpu and it even freezes when I try ctr alt f2 or the others) so I’m wondering what did I do wrong ( btw a reinstall did not help). I would be really glad if you can help me get this running cause it’s my first time running arch on a new laptop. Thanks again :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sirius1377"> /u/sirius1377 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8ui6k/arch_on_new_laptop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w8ui6k/arch_on_new_laptop/">[comments]</a></span>
