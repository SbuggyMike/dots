<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. I use an ASUS Q408UG laptop on which I recently installed Arch. I&#39;ve noticed that whenever I start my laptop from shutdown, the keyboard doesn&#39;t work. The keyboard does work in bios and grub. </p> <p>One temporary solution I&#39;ve found is to plug in a USB keyboard, which works, and reinstall linux-firmware. Once I reboot, the laptop keyboard works again, and will after subsequent reboots, but if I ever shut the laptop down the keyboard stops working again. </p> <p>Could this be a driver related problem? If so, does anyone know which drivers might help? Thanks for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bloodghoul6666"> /u/bloodghoul6666 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w62y6b/laptop_keyboard_not_working_after_shutdown/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/w62y6b/laptop_keyboard_not_working_after_shutdown/">[comments]</a></span>
