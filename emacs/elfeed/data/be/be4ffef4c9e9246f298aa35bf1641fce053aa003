<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This reads like a shitpost, but it isn&#39;t. I&#39;m 16, and have been interested in and using Linux for about 2 years. I liked the appeal but its now ruining me. I have this drive to use it for a reason I can&#39;t point to, aside from the fact that its &quot;comfy&quot; or something. I&#39;ve had issues with obsessing over privacy stuff too, basically ruining friendships over it, but this is worse. I recently (few days ago) installed Windows again, because I wanted to get back into music and start playing MSFS again. I move between them every few months, and right away always change partition types on my other drives, which contain about 4TB of data. So its a huge chore to move back and forth. On this most recent move though, I lost my gpg private key, which isn&#39;t even really that important, I just posted it on the keyservers, and signed some commits on irreverent 0 star repos with it, but I had a mental breakdown. I wanted to die because of the amount of self hatred I had for moving back and losing the key. I feel like I&#39;m cursed with this urge to use Linux. I just wish I could live my life and not worry about my operating system 24/7. It&#39;s literally my entire life and I can&#39;t anymore. I&#39;m depressed, suicidal and just so fucking over this shit. I just want to be normal. I want to just use Windows and be normal but I can&#39;t, And I want to reiterate that I have no real reason to use Linux over Windows, its worse for what I use my computer for, But I just feel like I need to use it for some reason, Like stockholm syndrome. Any advice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Mind_112"> /u/Competitive_Mind_112 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w7g5mx/im_obsessed_with_linux_and_its_ruining_my_life/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/w7g5mx/im_obsessed_with_linux_and_its_ruining_my_life/">[comments]</a></span>
