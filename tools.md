# An assessment of the Tools that I Use

## Text Editor

### Vim

#### Advantages 

Extremely easy to type
Minimalist
Great auto-completion
Not tied to the programme

#### Disadvantages

Not particularly easy to organise files - Seem to have resolved this by mapping <C-p> to fuzzy finder and typing the name of the file into the curren buffer
Can be hard to copy and paste
Hard to set up auto-correct - Might just have to live with this one

### Emacs

#### Advantages 

Very easy to organise and find files
Can integrate timers, calendars etc
Very customisable
Easy to set up auto-correct
Easy to naviagate within org files

#### Disadvantages

Worse keybindings (or dicking around with EVIL mode)
You must customise - huge time sink
Tied to an ecosystem
Substandard auto-completion
Violates UNIX philosophy (?)

(Find fuzzy finder for Vim)
(Look up how to use links in Vim)
(Auto-correct vim) 

### Verdict

Stick with Vim for now: it feels more like a tool than emacs, which is something of a cult

## Calendar/Scheduler

### Google calendar

#### Advantages 

Very easy to sync files
Intuitive layout
Quite flexible in how habits work

#### Disadvantages

Doesn't work well with shortcuts
Privacy (?)
Requires internet access

(Look up alternatives)

### Emacs

#### Advantages 

Keyboard-driven
Customisable
Doesn't require internet
Integrated into workflow

#### Disadvantages

Easy to be distracted because part of same programme 
Hard to get notifications (if required)
Habits are quite clunky - can't modify individual instances easily
You're only going to use it if you use Emacs as a text editor

### When

#### Advantages 

Minimalist
Text/keyboard based
Not distracting

#### Disadvantages

Learning curve
Won't be able to set up alerts
Is probably difficult to change individual instances of habits
Isn't going to sync very easily (perhaps it can be set up to do so)

N.b. these disadvantages probably apply to comparable alternatives e.g., calcurses

## File Format

### Markdown

#### Advantages 

Easy to use
Versatile

#### Disadvantages

Doesn't  particularly  format the text
